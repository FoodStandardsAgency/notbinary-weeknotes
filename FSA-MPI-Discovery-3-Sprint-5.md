# This week (16-20 Sep)

It's been a bonus discovery week for the Timesheeting team. We've been able to use this time to take stock and explore practically how the discovery research may be implemented. 

A 'potential / to-be' user journey mapping session early in the week gave us a chance to do some thinking out loud, to synthesise and explore options based on the recommendations put forward last week, and to build on a shared understanding of the essential pain points and service opportunities. 

Considering what the service _could be like_ has helped bring focus to both Statement of Resource planning and rota management as processes that - while adjacent to the core of timesheeting - do warrant further investigation to help design a holistically better integrated service. 

We've also had a phenomenal response to the surveys we sent out. Around two-thirds of ITLs have provided feedback, along with over 110 contractors and dozens of staff. That's helped validate and challenge some of the initial user research findings, and extend our research reach to the wider Field Ops community.  

The service blueprint review that also took place this week has helped make sure that our representation of how timesheeting fits into the business is accurate and complete. The feedback from Finance and Field Ops - who went through it "with a fine toothed comb" - has been excellent, and has helped clarify details for future service design and development. 

# Next week (23-30 Sep)

Next week is all about closing the discovery loop and doing final sense-checking of our recommendations with various contributors, particularly on the technology side. The extra research and analysis we've done this week also needs to be reincorporated into the report wiki and service blueprint. 

Some key actions include:
* Create service flow, mapping by activity and user group
* Re-validate service metrics
* Test recommendations with IT
* Carry out full discovery retrospective

The full retrospective will take place **1pm-2pm** on **Wed 25 Sep**, in **Room M208** at Foss House, York.  If you've been involved so far and are able to join us, you're most welcome. 

Acknowledging that not everyone may be able to, we'd still welcome all feedback and reflections so that we can improve how these discovery projects work for the benefit of all. Please do send them through via [this short survey](https://forms.gle/NqyZig2ZG77QAZLY8).
