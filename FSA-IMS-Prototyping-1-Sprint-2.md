# P1:S2 (23/09/19 - 27/09/19)

**Tl;dr**: Detailed review of backlog | Getting real life case data | Capturing business rules | Lining up more users for testing | Preparing to start first round of building and testing

## This week 
Top priority this week has been preparing our backlog - this is essentially a comprehensive list of things the team will be designing, building and testing against throughout the prototyping phase. These 'things' are mainly pieces of functionality that the new incidents management platform must be able to do to meet the user needs (as established in the Discovery phase). 

Preparing the backlog is time consuming - it's the core 'currency' that underpins and informs all of the team's work, so it's essential to give it the necessary effort and focus required. During this preparatory stage, the whole team discusses each line item (30+ in total) and asks things like:
- do we all have the same understanding of how each user need could potentially be translated to into a piece of functionality within the new tool?
- how much time and complexity is potentially involved for the team to develop each piece of functionality
- what are the conditions that the function must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer or other stakeholders?
Once we have agreed all this, we then prioritise all the items on the list to ensure we are working on the most important bits of functionality first. We then work through the list as we progress through the prototyping phase. 

Other things we have been doing this week include:
- Sketching out a proposed 'to be' blueprint for the service. We'll share this with you once there is a baseline for comment. 
- Capturing the business rules to understand the user permissions for the prototyping 
- Getting the real life data for our four chosen scenarios - Meat, Micro, Allergens and an Outbreak. This has been fiddly at times - special continued thank you our IRU colleagues for helping provide this.
- Setting up Dynamics and Clue in readiness for inputing data in readiness for some actual testing
- Identifying external service providers and potential end users to get involved with the testing work

## Next week 
We will be focusing on building some of the functionality related to providing 'a single source of truth for information about incidents and outbreaks'. This was judged to be the top priority in amongst the nine key user needs identified during the Discovery. We are expecting to test this with users (starting with members of the IRU) on/around Monday 30th Sept. 

We'll be in touch early next week to book a number of volunteers in for this. If you are not involved in this round of testing, we will be reaching out to other for the next round to make sure everyone who has volunteered gets an opportunity to be involved. 

See you at the Show and Tell next Tuesday at 1400.
