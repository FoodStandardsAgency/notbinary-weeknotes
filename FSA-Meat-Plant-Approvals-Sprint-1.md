## This week (10-19 Jun)

Meat Plant Approvals is a new discovery for the team that has been working with the FSA York community over the last 10 months. It’s a different domain to previous discoveries, and we welcome Paul McGuinness as our new FSA Product Owner (PO) and Paul Murray from Notbinary who is picking up the user research workstream. 

We actually snuck a couple of **orientation days** into the middle of the previous week - that helped give clear space for the scope briefing, a high level walkthrough of the core processes and related systems, and to coordinate and agree a working plan. It also gave time to identify and address gaps and resources needed to make progress, which meant we could hit the ground running in our first ‘proper’ week.

Approvals is an area that our previous discoveries kept pointing to, and as we have dived into the detail of documented processes and policies over the last week, it’s clear to see that this a **keystone service** of the FSA’s portfolio. Getting this bit right could make a real difference to the quality of relationship between the agency and food business operators (FBOs), as well as the experience of downstream processes and services, for both internal and external users. Even at this early stage, it feels like an important opportunity that we may well revisit in our service proposal. 

Along with procedural research, we’ve been able to review some of the historical feedback from FBOs on the approval process. Being able to track application status better is an operational priority for this discovery, and **visibility and communication of application status** has also been a key concern for businesses.  Our PO - in collaboration with Ops Transformation and Field Ops - has been working hard to unlock access to them for our research, so we can validate that feedback and truly understand where the process may not be meeting user needs and expectations.

Another driver for this project is the imminent deadline for **making government services accessible**. We’ve had a really helpful rundown of the requirements we need to consider. It’s encouraging to learn about the provisions that the FSA has made to support and maintain accessibility, and it is clear that this is being treated as a first-class citizen in the digital space. 

The schedule we’re working to is split between **discovery through research** and **learning through prototyping**. We’re already starting to identify the service and tooling components around which the Approvals process is currently modelled. There are some early candidates among these to tackle during prototyping. Insights from our user and stakeholder research over the next couple of weeks will help us prioritise those areas that are most useful to work up and test in the next phase.

## Next week (22-26 Jun)

The schedule for our next cycle is filled with interviews for stakeholders and internal users.  We’ve got sessions lined up with Legal, Veterinary Services, and Application Support, with more to set up in Finance, Data and Regulatory Control.  This will help us set the context and constraints for the service, as well as situate any service proposal in the context of recent and current projects. 

From the frontline, we’re going to be talking with various members of the Approvals team and Field Veterinary Leads that conduct the approval visits. 

Working around those, we’re looking to make progress with our prototyping setup and to start mapping across processes, task flows, service and tooling.

There’s no show and tell next week, but we’ll be back on 3 July to share our research insights from the next fortnight.
