# D7:S4 (06/01/20 - 10/01/20)

## This week

First week back in the New Year (and new decade!) has been a busy one. The team have had their heads down crunching through all the interviews and research from the last few weeks. We had a lot to digest! 

Essentially, we have been looking for themes, trends and insights that could help the team propose potential ideas for the FSA to consider. We will share the outputs of these in our final report, but some of the emerging observations include:

* There is awareness amongst users about the ability for them to report allergic reactions to food (or near misses) and where they can go to do this
* There are a number of organisations who have identified a need around food allergies in general
* There is confusion about the implementation of policy and FSA advice
* There seems to be a theme about users being motivated to report to help prevent other users from having a bad experience
* There is a general consensus that there has been an improvement in allergy awareness, management and treatment in the UK in recent years. The media are seen as playing a key role 

The other big story from this week is we received a phenomenal 453 responses to our user survey that was sent out just before Christmas. As mentioned previously, the main themes the survey wanted to explore were:

* Motivations about reporting
* Understanding behaviours from past reporting
* Understanding their awareness re. ability to report
* Attitudes to reporting reactions from different food types
* Feelings about sharing personal data

Some of the findings from our first round of analysis (before the survey formally closed) revealed:

* 52% of people who completed the survey suffer from a food allergy 
* 48% of people who completed the survey were responding on behalf of somebody else - 44% are parents 
* 77% of respondents country of residence is England, 6% Wales, 5% Northern Ireland 
* 73% of respondents have not reported an allergic reaction to food before
* 50%+ of respondents would like to hear about the outcome of any reporting

## Next week

We will be again locked in a room for a few days, turning around the analysis into some potential ideas for how the FSA can take the work forward into Phase 2 of the Discovery.

Key questions we will be addressing include:

* What motivates people to report an allergic reaction to food and/or a near miss?
* How can consciousness around reporting become mainstream?
* (How) would different user groups benefit differently from having a centralised reporting tool? 
* What would a centralised tool mean for the existing reporting mechanisms?
* What alternatives are there to a centralised reporting tool?

More on this next week.
