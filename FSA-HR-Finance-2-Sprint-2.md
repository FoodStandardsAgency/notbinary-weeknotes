# This week

Following a brief pause between sprints one and two, the HR & Finance Discovery is now in full flow. The early stages of a Discovery are usually a whirlwind; full of meet and greets as well the start of a busy workshop schedule and this week has been no exception.

This week we’ve met with a number of key stakeholders across Finance, HR and IT, including;

* Service Owners
* Product Owners
* Subject Matter Experts
* CSU representatives
* DDAT representatives

And we have run workshops on the following subject areas;

* FSA data and security (data sources, data management etc)
* Financial reporting  (forecasting vs actuals, reporting tools etc)
* Payroll (Gross to net checklist / month end, year end, mid month payruns, overtime, expenses, pensions etc)
* HR: People & Organisation Change (joiners, leavers, change of working patterns etc)

The sessions this week have given us an early view of some of the challenges that currently exist;

* High volume of manual processing required in order to complete tasks 
* A significant number of work arounds currently exist to mitigate capabilities that are either not currently being used in iTrent or don’t exist at all
* A significant volume of potentially preventable enquiries are being received into HR
* Some processes might be better served if handled by a single team (e.g. new starter process) 

Everybody we’ve met with has been very accommodating and supportive so a big thank you to everyone who’s been involved so far. 

Four service maps have been created off the back of this weeks workshops and we have held follow up sessions with HR and Finance stakeholders to understand pain points as well as associated volumes and metrics relating to the key activities identified.

# Next week

Another week of workshops will allow us to build on the knowledge gained this week and fill in some of the blanks. By the end of sprint three, we will have an understanding of activities / processes that are contained within a single directorate / team as well as those that span HR, Finance and IT. We are also booking in playback sessions where we review the service maps with HR, Finance & IT stakeholders to validate our understanding. 

Additional service maps will be created following the next round of workshops which will be validated and added to the project wiki, which is the repository for all of our project documentation.

We're starting to understand the different types of user and we’ll look to develop that understanding next week as we begin creating user personas. 

We have our first show and tell next week on Wednesday where we will be sharing this and more. We look forward to seeing you there!
