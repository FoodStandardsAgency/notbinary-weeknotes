## This week (2-6 Dec)

We've moved on from working up the user flow from the previous week to fleshing out the designs for Statement of Resource.  

Ideas have been flowing fast and feedback has been incisive from users. We finish the week on the fifth iteration, and there's been significant evolution and refinement of the what and how data is captured. For example: 
* switching from a form to grid view for laying out shift patterns and activity hours improves visibility of relevant data and speeds up entry
* capturing inspection points along with production hours opens up the prospect of making resourcing suggestions (if used with additional data, such as throughput and working patterns)

The design-feedback cycle is also highlighting the ambiguity of some of the language of SORs. For example, are operating hours:
* the times the establishment is accessible by staff? 
* the hours that FSA presence is needed?
* the line production times?
* or something else?  

Each interpretation could alter what you might record and subsequently resource against, as well as what you are effectively comparing in the SOR Accuracy reports. 

A key play to get consistency is through good guidance in the first instance - clear user/system documentation reinforced by relevant and specific contextual help. This is even more critical when changing an existing system that people have become used to working with in a certain way. 

In such cases (including with SOR), an important outcome of guidance training will be to unlearn habits and interpretations that are no longer applicable. This theme - behaviour change (and to a broader extent, culture change) - is one that we keep coming back to, especially at this stage of Discovery, as we look at options to improve inspection resourcing. 

Although our jumping off point has been the tools, approaching this as a digital service (re-)engineering project is likely to deliver more appropriate solutions and yield more sustainable outcomes. Technology and IT policy certainly have a role to play in enabling improved ways of working, but [can just as easily inhibit adoption and frustrate change](https://vimeo.com/377775446#t=26m26s) if not carefully considered. 

To that end, the plant visits this week have been a timely reminder of the practical, environmental and user context that inspection resourcing operates within. Systems and processes are generally designed to be predictable, but people and animals can always surprise. 

## Next week (9-13 Dec)

Discovery work continues with feedback sessions with Inspection Team Leaders and Area Managers on the next iteration of the SOR designs. 

That will feed into development of the user stories and application scorecards that can be used to support the next phase of work in this area. 

The service blueprint is progressing nicely, and we have a review with primary stakeholders on Wednesday to ensure it is accurate and complete. 

Alongside this, the focus is on write-up, and finalising the research, analysis and technology outputs. 

We'll also be carrying out a review ahead of the service assessment the following week. That will take place on Wed 18 Dec, along with:
* 9am-10am Final Show & Tell 
* 10:30am-12pm Discovery Retrospective

These will take place at Foss House in York, though you can dial in as normal to the Show & Tell. There'll be no Show & Tell in Sprint 6 (Fri 13 Dec).
