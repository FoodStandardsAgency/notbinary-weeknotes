## This week (9-18 Dec)

The start of sprint week 6 seems like a while ago now, as we have also gone through an intense period of wrap-ups, review and assessment since the [last weeknote](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-weeknotes/wiki/FSA-MPI-Resourcing-Discovery-6-Sprint-5). 

The focus of the final sprint has been **writing up** and polishing the discovery outputs so they are in a good state to handover for the next (post-discovery) stage of delivery. 

The rapid pace of discovery depends on regular playback and sense-check of findings. We do this through ceremonies such as [weekly show and tells](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/show-and-tells), as well as walkthroughs with subject matter experts.  It helps us check both our understanding and that the way we describe or present our work back to the client is accessible. 

As part of the write-up, in the last sprint we carried out a **review of key assets** such as the [service blueprint](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/service-blueprint). This happens in a single session across departments and with a range of stakeholders. The session was useful to make sure we've not missed something obvious, but participants across the business found it especially helpful to build their shared understanding of the service challenge and to align around ways forward. 

As well as the blueprint review, **prototyping with user feedback** has continued. We've drilled into data entry interactions for the Statement of Resource, iterating around ways to capture plant operating details. species processing and monthly activities.  

These changes are helping to focus the process and tool on capturing critical information needed to efficiently and consistently build up a resourcing profile for a plant. The response we're getting is that they can help answer basic questions such as *"how many people do we need?"* more quickly, both locally and in a way that facilitates building up the national resourcing model. 

We've tried out a few new approaches on this discovery since the team explored [Timesheeting](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-weeknotes/wiki#meat-plant-inspections), including the organisation of the discovery outputs in the project wiki. We produce a lot of content which it's easy to get lost with. So it's important that whoever takes the work forward can easily navigate the assets and understand how they fit together. A **handover and walkthrough** with the client this week has helped bring that all together, reinforce the knowledge transfer and hopefully avoid duplication of effort when the business is ready to build on the discovery work. 

Finally, the next (last?) big thing for the project has been the wrap-up day, with final [show and tell](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/show-and-tells), [retrospective](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/Retrospectives#full-discovery-retrospective) and [service assessment](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/service-assessment).  The team carried out a **self-assessment** to support the latter (which included FSA and external assessors). That was a useful process to make time during the intense pace of the discovery to take stock, reflect and pull together the findings in a coherent way. 

## What happens next

We have three [key recommendations](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/recommendations) from digging into Inspection Resourcing:

1. [Go back to basics with Statements of Resource](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/recommendations#statements-of-resource)
2. [Co-design a single shared Rota owned by the FSA](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/recommendations#rota)
3. [Review FBO interactions with the Inspections Service](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/recommendations#inspections-service)

There's plenty that could be done, and a lot of positive momentum and appetite for improvements to happen. Too much change at once could be adversely disruptive, and there's a balance to be struck to ensure a sustainable (and measurable) impact is made. 

To that end, we recommend the [starting point](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1auP2PJB2xgo6F2D7632JYc2esSTzyfF8WswVgr2Ic4w/edit#slide=id.g6c95ea4448_0_185) would be with Statement of Resource, as this will help build the foundations for integration between SOR, timesheeting and rotas that could help deliver a more effective Inspection service.

However the FSA chooses to proceed, the recommendations should also be considered in light of the principles set out in [discovery learnings](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/learnings-and-actions) and suggested [technology strategy](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/technology-recommendations):

1. [Be user-driven](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/learnings-and-actions#be-user-driven)
2. [Be service-led](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/learnings-and-actions#be-service-led)
3. [Involve partners and customers early](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/learnings-and-actions#involve-partners-and-customers-early)
4. [Unlock local knowledge](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki/learnings-and-actions#unlock-local-knowledge)



So, that's it from us. The Notbinary team have finished up on with Inspections Resourcing. We hope that our work has given the FSA a clear vision and strategy for how to move forward in this space, and that this builds on and aligns with the [recommendations from Timesheeting discovery](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-weeknotes/wiki/FSA-MPI-Timesheeting-Prototyping-Sprint-4#what-happens-next).  

As with Timesheeting, it's been a pleasure to work closely again with Field Ops and FSA Digital and to have such great contribution and support from across the internal and external stakeholder map on this project. We're taking a break over the holiday season, and hopefully will be back next year for more.
