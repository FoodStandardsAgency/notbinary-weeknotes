# D7:S9 (10/02/20 - 14/02/20)

## Last week

The team are currently impacting assessing eight ideas, presented at the end of Phase One. Ideas 1-4 involve an FSA-owned reporting tool, whilst ideas 5-8 involve obtaining data from other methods.

* Ideas 1 - 4: Creation of a new, stand alone reporting tool, with variations
* Idea 5: FBOs sharing their information (reported to them by users) with FSA
* Idea 6: LAs sharing their information (reported to them by users) with FSA
* Idea 7: NHS sharing their information (reported to them by users) with FSA
* Idea 8: Conducting regular, targeted user surveys

The ideas are not necessarily mutually exclusive i.e. FSA may decide to adopt two or more options to get the data it requires and provide a reporting tool for users.

By the end of Phase Two, the team will make recommendations about which options to take forward.

## This week

With only two weeks left to go, this week we will concluding the impact assessment work by reviewing the outputs from last week with the FSA team members. This is an important step - the team should collectively have agreed which of the nine ideas are the most suitable candidates to best meet both the FSA and user needs. 

Once agreed (on Tuesday) we will then focus our attention on drawing out what the most viable ideas could look like, including some possible design sketches to give people a visual flavour of how the solution may look. 

We'll also start fleshing out the final report which we will be presenting towards the end of next week.
