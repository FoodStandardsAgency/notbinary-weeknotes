**Tl;dr**: Legal clarifications | User research | Understanding how LAEMS works

## This week

On Monday we met with Ruth from the FSA’s legal team and went over our understanding and to review previous legal guidance. This went well and we came away with a clear understanding of the legal position.

Monday also saw the continuation of our user research, starting with Layo attempting to meet with Nottingham County Council (England) on Monday morning, however a slight mix up with contacts meant we were put in touch with the wrong team at the council. We are making plans to find an alternative local authority to talk to.

Monday afternoon was more successful and Layo met with Newport Council (Wales) and talked with the Principal Environmental Health Officer there.

On Tuesday, we met again with the Register a Food Business (RAFB) team, and the Science, Evidence and Research Division (SERD) also came along to discuss their requirements. As a result of this meeting we are going to focus on trying to speak to a Local Authority who is using RAFB Route 3 data standard.

More user research took place throughout the week and we will be sharing what we learnt very soon.

* Tuesday - Dacorum Council (England)
* Wednesday - Sheffield Council (England)
* Thursday - Fermanagh & Omagh (Northern Ireland)

With Tim away, Lana has provided support to the discovery team and on Wednesday both Lana and Lucy met with Esther and Andy from the team that manages Local Authority Enforcement Monitoring System (LAEMS) at the FSA to understand more about how the LAEMS system works and how the data validated and reconciled.

On Friday Lana stepped in again to meet with the Lambeth Council data architect as part of the user research session with Layo.

## Next week

We will be going over what we have learnt from the user research sessions and preparing to share our initial user research findings.

We will also be focusing on:

1. Why would the FSA invest in improving access to Local Authority food and feed business data?
2. Why would an LA want to improve the sharing of their food and feed business data with the FSA?

We’ll share our user research findings, with the wider team on Tuesday 11-12 at our third Show & Tell.
