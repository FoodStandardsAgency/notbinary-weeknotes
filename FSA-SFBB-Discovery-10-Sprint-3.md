# D10:S2 (09/03/20 - 13/03/20)

## This week

Last week we conducted x3 60 minute remote sessions with a total of 10 local authorities to understand their experiences relating to SFBB and Food Business Operators regarding:

* How FBOs initially discover SFBB
* Onboarding FBOs to SFBB
* Daily operations and SFBB
* Technology
* Accessibility
* Impact of SFBB on FBO's regulatory compliance

Local authorities we spoke with were:

* Cambridge
* Cheltenham
* Rushmoor
* Cornwall
* Luton
* Doncaster
* Hinckley Bosworth
* Wakefield
* South and Vale

We gleamed a significant amount of insight from the conversations. Some of the take aways from a local authority perspective were:

* The discovery part of the journey is perceived to be quite effective as most FBOs are made aware of SFBB through registration or first inspection. Despite this, some FBOs still fall through the cracks and are trading without SFBB in place. 
* FBOs are confused about the role of the SFBB pack
* FBOs are unclear how Food Safety Training and Safe Method fit together
* There is confusion about the intention of SFBB - not all FBOs understand what it is for.
* Completion rates vary widely
* There are a number of content issues e.g. information in the packs is not always relevant to the business type or may not be accommodating the business type 
* There are a number of accessibility issues e.g. having to print the packs can be prohibitive to businesses and is resulting in lower usage of SFBB
* There are a number of behavioural issues e.g. food safety often not seen as a priority over making money
* There are some food operators that use an alternative SFBB digital tools but this is rare. However LAs found that these tools were comprehensive in the details that they captured 
* Updates to the pack are not always communicated to the food operators 
* LAs were unclear in regards to the updates that were issued by FSA

## Next week

Due to disruption and sensitivities (particularly with FBOs) caused by the COVID-19, the discovery was paused on 24th March 2020.
