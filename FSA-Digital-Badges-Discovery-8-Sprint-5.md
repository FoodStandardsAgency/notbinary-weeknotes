# D8:S5 (24/02/20 - 28/02/20)

## This week 

The team's final week on the digital badges discovery.

On Wednesday we caught up with Karen and Bettina from Uber Eats, we gathered some good insights and learnt about what they are already doing, and what they plan to around FHRS and presenting hygiene ratings to customers. 

Thursday saw Paul and Ema in Newport to present and discuss our work with many local authorities as part of a two-day workshop. It was good to meet some many representatives of so many local authorities and gather some insight. 

The rest of our time was taken up with writing up our findings and recommendations, as well as preparing for our final show and tell.
