# This week (7-11 Oct)

This might sound obvious, but the last few weeks have been leading to this one. We're at the point where we're turning our discovery research into tangible designs to put in the hands of our users to show how the timesheeting experience could be improved. And it's exciting. 

The first pass threw up some great initial challenge and feedback from Digital Super Users and Inspection Team Leaders. That has helped us focus our design scope, understand better the tolerances for radical change, and be much clearer about why we have a prototyping phase, including what we can and can't achieve during it. It's less about rigidly defining what a new app will be like, and much more about challenging the assumptions and testing the interaction patterns that will inform a future development. 

Starting off with the core interface for logging activity and breaks at a site, over the next couple of weeks we'll incrementally build out the fuller timesheet entry flow as we incorporate feedback from each iteration. By the end of the process we should have a robust view of what the full app context could be like. 

We're focusing on quickly turning around ideas and feedback using paper prototypes rather than more interactive wireframes. That should help maintain some of the momentum we built during Discovery, while still being easily understood for our working group. They'll be picking these up asynchronously and have the option of scheduling followup calls for a walkthrough and to give feedback verbally. It's going to be interesting to see how well this works for the group - it's a new process with a widely distributed community that have relatively little availability. Plenty to keep an eye on to learn all-around.

Over the last fortnight we have heard mixed views about how well Statements of Resource (SOR) can be used to drive Timesheeting. We've spent some time this week understanding the technical and operational limits and affordances of that system. There's more to unpick - outside of the scope of this piece of work - but for now we do see ways to leverage it for presenting 
1. activity code options to users (to speed up timesheet data entry by frontline staff) 
1. weekly plant resourcing 'budget' against actual activity hours logged (for quick comparison by Team Leaders)

Drilling into SOR has helped us think more clearly about our service design goal, which is to make it quicker and easier for users to get reliable and current data about timesheeted activity, and especially anomalies so that appropriate action can be taken. 

One thing we are testing in the prototyping phase is how to make the timesheeting user interface [as simple as possible (and no simpler)](https://championingscience.com/2019/03/15/everything-should-be-made-as-simple-as-possible-but-no-simpler). Unpicking the complexity of business and policy rules is part of that process. Reviewing activity codes (as one area through which rules are applied), the analysis shows that these can be expressed quite discretely when applied to specific use cases. And it should be possible to reasonably cleanly model those scenarios in the app, which also helps clear the path for a simpler user interface. 

We've been building up a different picture alongside the design sketches - around the access model and technical architecture that might support a field-based timesheeting system. The discovery phase made clear some of the connectivity and related issues that significantly affect usability, and we've been looking at an architecture that might help address that. We had an encouraging response to the approach we outlined to security and infrastructure owners. The discussion was especially valuable to identify some of the specific platform and security needs that we should be considering. 

This phase is far from over (we're at the midway point now), but having reached what genuinely feels like a turning point this week, it's interesting to reflect on how far we have come in a relatively short space of time, and what structures have helped create the beneficial conditions for our progress: 
* We work as a distributed team by default, but co-locate 3 days a week on the client site. Sharing [meatspace](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace) reduces delivery frictions, supports responsive collaboration and helps build team culture, but we can easily slip into good remote working flow.
* Our sprints are only 1 week, with consistent standups, retrospectives and planning ceremonies. The turnaround cycle is normalised - a good habit without being stale. The cadence is energetic and productive. It's intense, but we're finding a routine that works to make it so while keeping negative pressure at bay.
* The client is immersed in and has embraced our process. We're on the same rhythm week-to-week, and that helps make things hum. 
* We work transparently, and have open communication channels with our stakeholders. We solicit regular and direct feedback (and especially challenge), including through weekly show and tells. It keeps us on track, and helps surface related contexts that we should be aware, and that helps us do better and focused work. 

Kudos to the teams at the FSA for helping us build and sustain that operating model with them. 

# Next week (14-18 Oct)

Iterating and extending the prototype scenarios is the key line for week 3, in particular: 
* user feedback on core timesheet entry
* planned absence scenarios 
* timesheet landing page / user dashboard
* plant timesheet reconciliation

Alongside the designs there's additional analysis work to do elaborating related user stories, acceptance criteria and business rules that could also support post-prototype development. Previous conversations to follow up include Field Ops reporting and infrastructure guidelines, as well as iterating and getting feedback on the technology direction and related security thinking.
