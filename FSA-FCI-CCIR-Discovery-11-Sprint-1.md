## This sprint (23-27 Mar)

We’ve had a solid start to this new discovery, rolling straight into the world of Food Chain Information (FCI) and Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR) after wrapping up a look at opportunities across [Field Ops Inspection](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fieldops-inspections/wiki) domains in the previous week. 

The work done by the Product Owner and Digital Lead (and their teams) that happened behind the scenes in preceding weeks to clarify to tighten the scope and align business expectations. 

Our priority is to clarify responsibilities of the FSA and other stakeholder bodies for managing FCI and CCIR data, and to articulate the user needs and system requirements necessary for meeting its statutory duty.

The focus of this week has been to get a good enough understanding of the FCI and CCIR landscape to build up our discovery plan. 

Key events to support this have included:

- **scope briefing** to establish context of and purpose for the discovery, and to define clear boundaries to our enquiry.

- **kickoff** with subject matter experts to identify the relevant processes, challenges and related business activity (including projects within or external to the FSA), as well as the key stakeholder groups.
- **user segment mapping** to identify primary and secondary research group targets.

There’s been a huge amount of technical information to absorb for this discovery in the form of, eg, Manual of Official Controls and the Meat Industry Guide. We’ve started navigating that to help map out the discovery space and inform our understanding of what is 

It’s also been really useful to get some initial interviews under our belt. 

- SLA & Contracts has both provided solid background on the strategic, commercial and value chain context.
- Legal has outlined and signposted to clear regulatory requirements that constrain service design and delivery.
- Application Support has helped build our understanding of how the key system - IRIS - currently functions to enable lifecycle data management. 

We will no doubt be returning to these key stakeholders later in the project as our findings emerge. 

## Next sprint (30 Mar - 3 Apr)

There's a lot more background information to absorb, including key parts of the Meat Industry Guide and core legislation, over the next sprint week. 

A key task to complement the stakeholder mapping is a task flow review. This will help identify the core activities and users involved at different stages of the data lifecycle.  It will also help steer the focus of enquiry during research interviews. 

A priority will be to get the first wave of those sessions booked, and to start developing the scripts needed to conduct those consistently. We’re looking to get primary user interviews started from week commencing 6 April. It remains to be seen what the impact of COVID and self-isolation will be on being able to make progress here. 

We return with [Show and Tells](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fci-ccir/wiki/show-and-tells) next week on Fridays 11am-12pm, and look forward to sharing plans and findings with the stakeholder community.  We’re also going to try a Q&A chat session using Microsoft Teams on the following Mondays (12:30pm-1pm) for those that can’t join us for the live updates.
