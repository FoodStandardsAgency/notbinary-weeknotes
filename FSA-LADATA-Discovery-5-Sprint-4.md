# This week

On Monday we spoke to product and business analysts at Northgate, who provide the Assure MIS to around 40 Local Authority customers in England and Wales. They’ve also worked on product updates related to the introduction of the Scottish National Database, which replaces LAEMS in Scotland. From this conversation, we learned about the current reporting and export processes available to LAs, as well as how changes could be made to these. Northgate shared a template XML output used for LAEMS which is a useful resource to see how it’s changed into the final report. 

We went on to have our first Show & Tell on Tuesday – thank you to those who joined us; for everyone else, [the slides can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qwpqzIb9uBzOrjVEJzpWpewyV8J43FyatNiQKFOtdjo/edit?usp=sharing). Our takeaways were that:
* We’d made an assumption – that receiving more data from LAs would not be useful unless it was of a better quality – that needs to be validated with the analytics team
* Some points on the FSA’s legal position did not marry up with RCD members’ understanding, so we need to have a longer discussion next week once we’ve met with the FSA lawyers
* Different teams within the FSA have had different experiences of LAs’ position on sharing additional information, so we need to take a more nuanced approach to this

Our retrospective on the project so far was overwhelmingly positive, with particular kudos to Mark and Os for their support, and to the RCD team for their participation in our workshop and proactivity in sharing useful resources. Internally, we then had a bit of a ‘stock take’ of what we know so far vs which questions we still need to resolve. The key ones are:
* How usable is LA data in its current state?
* Would the FSA be able to handle additional data of the same state?
* Can the goals outlined by the RCD – such as better distribution of resources based on risk – be achieved (at least in part) in another way?

We finished up the week with a conversation with Alex at Epimorphics and a run-through of Unified View with Os, and Layo kicked off user research with Cheshire West and Chester Council.

# Next week

We’ll start week 3 of the discovery ‘proper’ with a call with Ruth from the FSA’s legal team to validate our understanding of some of the nuances of the legal position. We’ll share that, and our initial user research findings, with the wider team on **Tuesday 11-12 at our second Show & Tell**. 

On Tuesday, we’ll also reconvene with the Register a Food Business team to ensure that we’re covering their requirements. We’re hoping to add in a meeting with another MIS provider and members of FSA who work with data on a daily basis. 

Throughout the week, Layo will be continuing with user research, speaking to a further four Local Authorities across the UK. Tim, meanwhile, will be away for the next two weeks, and Lucy will be popping off to Berlin at the end of the week.
