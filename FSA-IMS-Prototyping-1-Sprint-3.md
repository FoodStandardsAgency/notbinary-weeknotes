# P1:S2 (30/09/19 - 04/10/19)

**Tl;dr**: Preparing for and conducting start first round of building and testing 
 |  Capturing business rules | Developing the target solution | Thinking about the second round of building and testing 

## This week 
The team are conducting the first round of user testing early next week, so this week everyone has been working hard to make sure all the necessary features are up and running within Clue and Dynamics for users to play around with. The first round of testing will how well the two tools can meet the user need for 'a single source of truth for information about incidents and outbreaks'. This was collectively rated the top priority for users of the service, so it makes sense to look at this first.

To do this, we essentially have taken the details agreed in the team's backlog (see last week's weeknotes for details), and have then built/configured the supporting features that together will hopefully provide the 'single source of truth'. We have also created some 'test scripts' that will ensure that each individual test is consistent to allow us to compare and contrast feedback. 

As well as conducting the first round of testing, we are also developing our overarching 'target solution' for the Incidents Management Service. Whilst the individual tests, described above, are exploring how well Clue and Dynamics can meet specific user needs, we need to be thinking about the whole, end to end service ecosystem. By considering all the user needs and the business rules/requirements (plus any constraints), this will seek to challenge the way things are currently done by making suggestions how things could be potentially be done differently (more efficiently). This will be technology-agnostic as well. The target solution is evolving throughout the prototyping stage - we'll be sharing this with users for input and feedback as it develops. 


## Next week 
Once we have finished the first round of testing, we will be immediately preparing for the next round! In fact, we've already started the preparation work for the second round - we've been to identifying all the necessary business rules and requirements to input into the design thinking before we get ready to build/configure for the next round. 

During this next round we will be exploring the next set of user needs from the prioritised backlog, including
- Automatic audit trail for service providers to effectively evaluate an incident
- Ability to search incident data for relevant information

Don't forget, if you are not involved in this round of testing, we will be reaching out to other for the next round to make sure everyone who has volunteered gets an opportunity to be involved. 

See you at the Show and Tell next Tuesday at 1400.
