FSA Digital Badges Discovery 8 Sprint 4

# D8:S4 (17/02/20 - 21/02/20)

## This week 

We had sessions with Claire from Casual Dining Group, which includes well known brands, such as Cafe Rouge, Las Iguanas, Belgo, Huxleys, Oriel, Bella Italia). Our key insights from Claire were: 

* There needs to be more consistency of delivery from EHOs across local authorities
* Be aware of practicalities, timelines and upload information from a technical implementation capability
* Location of badge, especially on multi-location businesses websites

Tracey from Punch Pubs, which is a group that has over 1,300 pubs operating with two types of pub, a managed partner, which is similar to a franchise model, and leased and tenanted, where the pub is run by a single owner/operator. 

Our key insights from Tracey were: 

* Communication will be very important - how would this work in practice. How would notifications between LA about infractions work? 
* Authenticity - what happens in an appeals process - timelines for publishing 
* Implementation for a single site operator - how would this work when the user is not technical. This could result in small businesses to shut down website and just rely on social media as it would be easier

Duncan from the Restaurant Group which has over 50 brands, including Costa, Wagamama, and Giraffe.

Duncan told us that registering virtual brands are problematic. Because they are not actually a new business (they are using an already registered kitchen), however the LA views them as new food business each time, so they get multiple inspections when they should get just one. 

We also worked with Carbs to better understand the technology implications and focused on four key areas:

* Unique Identifiers (UID)
* Tracking (eg, could we track the placement / usage or badges)
* Asset delivery (eg, what formats do we deliver this in - thinking along the lines of giphy offering different versions / sizes / languages)
* Governance (eg, ensuring correct businesses use correct ratings assigned to them / make them unhackable)

## Next week 

Next week is our last week, and will be focused on writing up our findings and making our recommendations. However, we still have a meeting planned with Karen from Uber Eats to gather insights from a large food aggregator.
