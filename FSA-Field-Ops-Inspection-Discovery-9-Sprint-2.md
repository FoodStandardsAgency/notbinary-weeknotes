## This week (3-7 Feb)

Having established a high-level view of the scope in the previous week, Sprint 2 has been focused on preparing for user interviews, filling in background research and mapping the tooling landscape.

The research schedule is almost complete. We have a good spread of interviews and visits lined up to inform the discovery across the next three weeks, tackling each of the dairy, meat (unannounced) and wine domains in discrete sprints in that order.  

This structure allows us to focus on each domain without distraction, building up a sense of the essential functions, needs and tooling of inspection within each area, and then being able to compare for commonalities. Each workstream is essentially focussed through different lenses: 

* **Analysis:** what the operational and governance requirements / expectations are for delivering inspections (such as defined in, eg, the Manual of Official Controls (MOC)
* **User:** the context, constraints and needs for users that influence or affect how inspections are actually delivered
* **Interaction:** how the existing tooling and technologies in place enable users to meet the expected inspection delivery outcomes

Following the initial conversations with lead inspectors, we've been pulling out the key systems and technologies used at each potential stage of the inspection lifecycle. This is helping to develop a catalogue of the common tooling functions needed across domains, such as some kind of scheduler in the planning stage, and a repository to store evidence and reports for future reference. 

It's also been invaluable to spend some time with Operations Assurance to understand the strategic context and prospects for inspections, based on a recent official controls review and the emerging operational vision.  This has helped elaborate some of the background to Field Ops changes that affect the inspections work we are researching. It also might give us a useful anchor against which to position recommendations from this discovery, to help with programme planning going forward.

## Next week (10-14 Feb)

Thematically we'll be working on building the collective understanding of how dairy inspection functions next week, through a combination of user interviews and site visit with Dairy Hygiene Inspectors. This will be supplemented by a deeper look into some of the key tools used within this space, such as K2 Scheduler, forms and inspection reports.

There are adjacencies with Auditing, and while we aren't planning site visits and extensive user research within this function, we've got an overview session scheduled which will help fill out the context and touchpoints for activities such as unannounced inspections, which are triggered through and feed back into audits. 

At the end of the week we'll be pooling our collective insights to examine our gaps, identify emerging themes and assess how far the assumptions we started with can be validated. Then we regroup and switch focus to Unannounced Inspections the following week, to build on our findings to date.
