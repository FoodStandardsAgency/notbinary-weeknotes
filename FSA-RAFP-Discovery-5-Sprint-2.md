## This week

Following last week’s research and observations, we’ve developed a solid understanding of the experience of Report a Food Problem from the perspective of the consumer, FSA staff, and local authority, and where the pain points fit in. We’ve summarised this in a How RaFP works document, and began to draft ideas for recommendations, driven by the pain points. We have a handful of ideas, some of which are low-effort, others much higher. For instance:

* Enable LAs to reply to the complainant via email by using the ‘reply-to’ field
* Notify complainants when a complaint cannot be processed
* Ask the user to specify or confirm the location of the issue on a map

## Next week

Next week we’ll share the draft ideas with Sally to validate we’re on the right track. From there, we’ll expand on them in a deliverable document, and make it more clear what level of effort would be involved in each one. For certain pain points, we expect we’ll recommend improving the metrics around them to validate the frequency of the issue (e.g. malicious reports). We’ll also seek clarification from Sally on a few remaining questions about exceptional manual review cases.
