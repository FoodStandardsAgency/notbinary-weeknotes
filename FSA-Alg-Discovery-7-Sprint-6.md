# D7:S5 (20/01/20 - 24/01/20)

## This week

This week we have formally be taking a short pause between Phase One and Phase Two next week. During this time we have undertaken:

* Formal presentation of Phase One findings and emerging ideas to the Business Sponsors 
* Service assessment 
* Extended Show and Tell to the wider stakeholder community. 

Each session allowed us to talk about the last five weeks work (Phase One) in depth. It has been useful to get feedback from different stakeholders and provide challenge some of our work - always in a friendly manner we're pleased to add! On the whole, the sessions have gone well. 

Perhaps the critical takeaway from our work to date is that our research has confirmed that people DO want to report when they have had an allergic reaction to food. So there is a clear user need. 

Other themes our presentations have covered in terms of key findings are:

* Awareness
* Behaviours of organisations
* Consumer behaviour 
* Data
* Potential reporting solution 

Currently we believe there are two types of ideas worth exploring in more detail:

* A formal solution could be an FSA owned service/tool that is easily discoverable and easy to use
* An informal solution would be more light touch, using a combination of approaches e.g. proactively scanning (and responding to ) comments in social media, working more closely with  third parties to stimulate and incorporate innovative ways of collecting data e.g. iwaspoisoned.com. 

We'll be exploring these ideas in more detail in Phase Two. 

## Next week

Phase Two will be seeking to deep dive on a number points, including:

* Confirm the data rules that will need to apply to any solution - how do the data rules align with the data the FSA wishes to collect
* What will the FSA do with the data? E.g. consume/push out to LAs? Similarly, how would outcomes be subsequently reported?
* Impact assess the formal/informal approach against different stakeholders
* What could be the relationship with a potential reporting service with a) IRU and b) ‘Report A Food Problem’ service?
* Service design principles - what does the service really need to do, how would it be guided etc.
* How could we use some of the third parties more effectively?
* What could the reporting solution look like and where could it reside?
* Discoverability considerations
* What sort of ‘outcome’ details would users want to hear about?

We'll be starting to drill down on these points next week - although not all at once!

Will keep you posted.
