# This week

At we entered into the fourth of our five weeks, we regrouped to assess our progress so far. We felt that we’ve covered most of the legal, technical and practical questions of this discovery, but that there are still some gaps around the user needs, both for the FSA and the LAs. We intend to fill these in with further analysis of the documentation that’s been shared with us as well as some in-depth conversations with RCD team members, and also to recommend steps to refine these after the end of the discovery. 

Layo has been sifting through her notes from the seven user research sessions to find the common themes and pain points. While the Local Authorities we spoke to had a variety of MIS, team sizes and resource, there was some consensus in the challenges they face while completing their work. Key takeaways:
* The data in the LAs’ MIS tends to be that which is required for external reporting; any additional information is usually in paper form (scanned & linked to a business record)
* LAEMS returns are very painful, and therefore there is a perception that any further data sharing would be difficult

We shared this in our third Show & Tell on Tuesday ([see the video here](https://vimeo.com/372839348)), along with what we learned about the LAEMS process and its place in performance management from Esther and Andy. Attendees fed back that we need to be sure to consider the various elements of the RCD’s responsibilities – how data shapes policy and strategy, rather than just how it impacts LA performance management. We’re also speaking to Helen from the performance team this morning to validate and deepen our understanding.

Civica gave us an overview of their MIS systems – APP and the new Cx – and how extracting data works in each. They were also able to share their experience of the Scottish National Database rollout. Their responses were consistent with those of Northgate; we hope to validate both against Tascomi, who we’re speaking to on 25 November.

Finally, we confirmed the legal wording of the RCD position with an FSA lawyer – this will be shared in Show & Tell next week as well as in the final report.

# Next week

In order to better understand how data is used outside of LA performance management, we will be speaking to James from the FHRS team and Darren from the analytics team next week. Then we’ll be full steam ahead into documentation mode to ensure we’ve captured all we’ve learned in our written report.

We’ve decided to move our **Show & Tell to Friday 22nd November 1-2pm** in order to include what we learn from James, Darren and others. We’ll then be sharing our written report for the FSA team’s review, before a final in-person playback in early December.
