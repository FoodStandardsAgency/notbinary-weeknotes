## Discovery Assessment - Food Standards Agency - Timesheeting Service 

### Assessment Outcome: **Pass with Recommendations** 

The assessment was carried out in Food Standards Agency in York on 29 October 2019

## Summary
The multidisciplinary team formed well with a blend of suppliers and an empowered product owner and change manager from the business. They established a focused and achievable scope, engaged well with each other and their stakeholders and implemented efficient and sustainable agile working practices. Their documentation is proportionate and the panel appreciated its clarity and organisation.    

## Service Design and User Needs
The team have a good well articulated understanding of the end to end service, they managed to convey confidently that there is a good grasp of a number of delivery challenges and are not blind to some of these in moving to alpha. 

The team developed a good understanding of users and their needs. Followed a mixed methods approach and worked hard to cover a range of users and locations. The whole team were involved in research activity and should try to keep doing this as the service continues to alpha.

There is a plan for understanding how to design a service that meets accessibility guidelines, but have not yet carried out research with users who have specific access needs. Consider how you will test an alpha service with users who visual, mobility or cognitive impairments. 

Research outputs have been well documented, with clear personas linked to service outcomes. A small improvement could be made to personas by using an age range - using a specific age makes it look like they’re for a single person.

Great to see early prototyping and rapid feedback from users. Nice process for recording feedback on prototypes.

There are very good narratives, descriptions and clear summaries of the user personas and user journeys.  Pain points are clearly articulated, are well focused and linked to good descriptive realisable opportunities to solve these (with likely impact to those identified users). 

The team have at points had their scope and direction shaped by FSA constraints.  It has been good to see these identified in the wider documentation.  Some challenge of these in the next phase may be preferable.  For example:
* testing the assumption that the problem space is unique to the FSA and the specific situation, rather than considering the use of commodity tools.
* testing some of the FSA conventions around the driving needs (being clearer on the need for specific information collection)

It is not so clear that the Finance or HR needs are fully understood and further research may be required to help identify the key minimum needs from Finance / HR.  

## Technology
The team have outlined a reasonable (as in feasible) architectural approach for basing an alpha. However, there are some areas to explore before moving too far into an alpha:
* The FSA from an architectural point of view should help shape the prefered tools, review the security models and constraints
* The FSA from an information security point of view should challenge and review the statement that the data is low risk from a GDPR point of view. The FSA should look to reassure itself that it understands the data it holds and implications.  
* The FSA IT team should look to reassure itself that there are mechanisms for providing the right access to the data that is needed from existing systems in a manner and time frame that will make the next phase viable
* The FSA should explore adding some monitoring to the existing system to help provide reasonable level of insight into use metrics and issue identification

## Business Analysis
The size of the problem has been well quantified, showing the impact across the organisation. You will need to develop clear measures to test against for Alpha. You will need to continue to secure buy-in from the organisation, because some of the benefits are not cashable and might be hard to prove. You will need clear senior service ownership from finance during alpha, to make sure you can manage dependencies and explore opportunities to transform the way the business works.

## The Team and Ways of Working
Very good agile processes within the team - the engagement with the core set of stakeholders also came across really well, with a knowledgeable and engaged product owner.  There seemed to be good join up with the key stakeholder groups within the FSA.  It is less clear the FSA was more widely aware (potential for significant new constraints to come in at a late stage).  The team should clarify that the wider FSA stakeholder base have engaged in the discovery.  

The project wiki is excellent. This is very well organised and documented project.

Really good to see the engagement level with the field team users.  Also note that the weeknote summaries of the sessions were really helpful additional context.  

## Recommendations 
1. Carry out additional research to better understand the needs of finance users and users with accessibility needs.
1. Articulate more clearly the business benefits of the service for each user type to help inform the business on value for money. 
1. Research the problem space more rigorously to identify use cases where similar problems have been solved.
1. Carry out a technical spike to satisfy the team it has the capability to develop test and support new APIs in the stated environments.
1. Investigate the impact of connectivity, devices and environments on the service for remote users. Identify improvement options and steer for future design (for example an on/offline service and/or alternative methods of connection. 
1. Ensure a sustainable multidisciplinary team is in place before commencing alpha.
1. Embed the Product Owner role into the organisation and ensure new POs are fully supported with appropriate training and development.
1. FSA technical architect should help shape the prefered tools, review the security models and constraints.
1. FSA information security should challenge and review the statement that the data is low risk from a GDPR point of view. The FSA should look to reassure itself that it understands the data it holds and implications.  
1. The FSA should explore adding some monitoring to the existing system to help provide reasonable level of insight into use metrics and issue identification.
