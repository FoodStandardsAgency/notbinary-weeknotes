# This week

It’s been another intense but good week as we continue to grow our understanding of the HR & Finance operations. We’ve run four user journey workshops, have drafted around a dozen user personas and have begun formulating some “how might we” statements to start to focus our thinking a bit more on how we might approach some of the pain points you’ve shared with us. We've even squeezed in a visit to Clive House in London to meet with some of our stakeholders and map out end user journeys in iTrent.

We had our first show and tell this week. Thanks to everyone who attended, we hope you found it informative / useful and look forward to seeing you again next week! The team certainly enjoyed the opportunity to engage with a broader audience and share what we’ve been doing. 

The show and tell was followed up with out first sprint retrospective - where we discuss what has worked well so far and what we can improve - and have agreed on two or three improvements that we’ll incorporate in our ways of working over the next three weeks which is the main purpose of a sprint retrospective.

I couldn’t write this week note and not mention meeting invites! We’ve been working closely with CSU and IT to get these right - thank you for your continued patience whilst this happens as we know it has caused a barrage of meeting invites being received into your inbox. Onwards and upwards!

# Next week

The task of writing up the various project artefacts such as user journeys and user personas continues. We will be running a series of follow up workshops with IT, Finance and HR where we play these back. Its also an opportunity for us to refine and enrich the information we have captured. Next week we will also be conducting some ethnographic research (side by side, observational sessions!) where we can see some of the things we’ve discussed during workshops in action. 

We will also start translating the requirements we’ve gathered thus far into User Stories, which is one of our key deliverables for this Discovery. A simplistic definition of a User Story is that it captures a requirement of some kind but the correct way of thinking about a User Story is that it describes an end goal captured in a format that focuses on the user and the value delivered back to that user.  For an Alpha / Beta / MVP, User Stories are prioritised by the Product Owner and form the basis of the development work to be undertaken in development Sprints.

This will be another week where we largely listen, absorb and playback information you’ve shared with us but with a growing focus on our emerging thoughts based on the opportunities for improvement identified.
