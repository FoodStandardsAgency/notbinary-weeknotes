## This week (2-6 Sep)

This week we've been validating our discovery findings and testing understanding and ideas for improvement with a broader community of stakeholders. That's helping to clarify the practical options to take into a next stage. 

The service mapping workshop on Tuesday was the perfect place to bring users from across the service journey together. It's helped us build up a joined-up picture from the pieces we'd been collecting over the first two weeks, as well as reveal the gaps we still need to plug. We picked up some valuable insights from across Field Ops, Finance, HR and IT. 

Everyone's been very generous with their time and experience, and the appetite for making a better timesheeting service was palpable in the room. 

Our new interaction designer Sophie joined Stephen (business analyst) and Stuart (user researcher) on a tour of meat plants around Lincolnshire on Wednesday. The variety of environments and operating conditions was as eye opening as observing the inspection work on the line. It's helped put some real grounded context into where the process fits into the daily experience of inspectors, vets and auditors. It's also shaping our thinking of what may or may not work to help improve the user experience.

Kudos to Mark Deakin, who did a great job of coordinating the workshop and site visits, as well as a host of interview calls with Inspection Team Leads and other backoffice stakeholders.  The additional interviews are rounding out our understanding of a couple of key user journeys - **approving timesheets** and **reconciling timesheets against expected chargeable activity** - alongside the process of **entering and submitting timesheets**. 

Through conversations and playback with users and other stakeholders, as well as the workshops, site visits and Show and Tells, we've been getting consistent validation that these three stages of the process are critical for the timesheeting service to yield the accurate and timely data needed to support charging, payroll and field operations. 

Meanwhile, David's forming a clear picture of what the technology approach might to  support improved timesheeting user experiences that deliver better data-driven outcomes for the FSA. 

## Next week (9-13 Sep)

Our final discovery week is all about pulling these strands together and presenting some clear options to take forward.  

There is a lot of deep dive research around the supervisory and backoffice processes to make sense of from the end of this week. We have some clear anchors around which to synthesise this with what we've previously discovered, and that will help us with iterating and aligning the service map, user journeys, and tech/data context. 

There are some practical next steps that we want to elaborate on, as well as some longer term opportunities that could start to be progressed. Rather than a radical service transformation, we're envisaging an approach that can be taken incrementally, and as it progresses could usefully unlock further improvement options at a manageable pace. 

So, plenty to write up next week ahead of the final show and tell (Friday 11am-12pm). Hopefully you can join us.
