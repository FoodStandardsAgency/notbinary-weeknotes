We write project #weeknotes to think out loud, to share our learnings with our clients (and our own teams) and to contribute to the wider digital government community. They are open by nature and collaborative by design but they have some rules.

### The rules
1. **Stay in your lane**. Project weeknotes should be focused on the project not anything else interesting that may or may not have happened. In-jokes are out.
2. Keep them **conversational and friendly but professional**. A good discipline is to write them as if for an audience of one stakeholder rather than a vague 'public'.
3. **Don't name individuals without their permission**. Just because we favour working in the open doesn't mean everybody does.
4. **Celebrate successes and acknowledge challenges** - but avoid blame. If it isn't something you would be prepared for someone else to write about your work don't publish.
5. We support an **Internet of Links**. Wherever possible link to other resources, inspirations, conversations and particularly to other weeknotes.
6. When we link to client materials we link to things THEY have published openly. We **don't publish previously private content** even if it seems entirely un-controversial. **We NEVER EVER share commercial or sensitive information.**
7. The goal - above all else - is **provide a narrative of progress**. Weeknotes should be used as a supplement to 'show and tells' not as a replacement nor as simply somewhere to re-produce the same information.
8. **Be specific enough to provide insights for those outside the immediate stakeholders or users** who can add insights or different perspectives.
9. Always **get a second pair of eyes to read them** before you hit publish.
10. **If you aren't sure about something ASK**. Sean is your first port of call.
