# This week

This week’s focus has been to prepare ourselves for next week, when we’ll kick off sessions with stakeholders and subject matter experts. 

Layo focused on scheduling and preparing user research with Local Authorities. We’re aiming to speak to people within the food safety teams at Local Authorities in different regions and using different Management Information System (MIS) providers. We’ve shared the discussion guides we’ve put together with Mark and the SERD team for feedback before we start our conversations. 

Paul and Tim, meanwhile, were focusing on reading through the relevant legislation and policy around data sharing for Local Authorities and the FSA. The key documents are the Food Standards Act, Food Law Code of Practice, and the Framework Agreement on Official Feed and Food Controls by Local Authorities. We’ll clarify any uncertainties with the FSA’s lawyers in the near future.

Lucy was working on arranging next week’s meetings, defining the scope more tightly and (unfortunately) being poorly at home. 

# Next week

We’re visiting Epimorphics on Tuesday to learn about the research they carried out with Local Authorities and the Regulatory Compliance Division within the Unified View project. We’ve prepared by reviewing the documentation from that work and hope to get their steer on any gaps remaining.

On Friday, we’re looking forward to meeting with representatives from the Regulatory Compliance Division to discuss the needs for and benefits of further food safety data. Thank you to Mark Davis for arranging the session and for all the team members coming to join us at Clive House. 

We’re now going to have our **first Show & Tell on Tuesday 29th October 11-12** on https://whereby.com/fsa-la-data.
