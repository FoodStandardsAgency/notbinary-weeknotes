## This week (9-13 Sep)
We moved out of Foss House this week, heading across the bridge to Mallard. It was strange not being among FSA friends, though our new neighbours were also lovely. The last week of Discovery has been mostly about consolidating our research and analysis, and the final write-up. We did our final Show & Tell to present findings and recommendations earlier today. 

The main themes in our findings - which reinforce previous research projects - are that: 
* Connectivity and system access slow down entering and reviewing timesheets 
* Users need to manually cross-check against a number of data sources (eg, SOR, rota, IHR) 
* Errors are easy to make, and the system doesn’t give users helpful or timely feedback
* Existing technology is not designed to meet modern standards

There is a recurring question about whether timesheeting is even necessary. The reality is the current legislation makes it unavoidable. Changing the business model of inspections charging that might eliminate it is a long term endeavour. In the meantime there are very practical and manageable steps that can be taken to make it a more efficient and effective service. 

For any subsequent Alpha phase, there are two key areas to test against to begin that service transformation process: 
1. **Prototype user experience improvements** for pivotal user journey stages: 
   * timesheet entry
   * comparing rota vs hours worked
   * user notifications
   * SOR reconciliation
1. **Investigate remote access** options for:
   * mobile user experience with offline sync
   * balancing security and remote access performance issues

This week we've also issued surveys across Field Ops staff, contractors and managers to start wider (field) testing of our findings and the recommendations that are based on them. The early responses are proving fascinating and will really help inform any prototyping and service re-design that may be carried out in the next stage. 

For now, and to bring this stage to a close, we give **kudos** to all the people at the FSA - as well as contractors out there in the field - who have been involved with the timesheeting discovery. The Field Ops and backoffice staff have been full of wisdom, experience and generosity of spirit, and the project support we've received from CBI and DDAT has been vital to make progress in such a short window.  

This has been a fascinating journey of discovery for the team. We hope our fresh (and widely opened) eyes on the service have helped give some clear options for the FSA to realise benefits for all users across the operation.

## Moving forward
Time for the Timesheeting Discovery has now run out. While discussions and decisions are being made on the suggested options to take forward to an Alpha, we've got a bit of wrap-up to do:
* Complete Service Blueprint validation 
* Carry out full Discovery retrospective
* Review Field Ops surveys
* Hold a Show & Tell Q&A followup

There are a few technology conversations - particularly around SIR and prototyping - that we want to begin exploring over the next few days. The timesheeting research and opportunity is a good entry point for having those, and building our understanding here should also benefit other discovery and potential alpha work that the FSA undertakes.
