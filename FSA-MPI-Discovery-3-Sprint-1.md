# D3:S1 (19/08/19 - 23/08/19)

## This week (19-23 Aug)
The team landed in the FSA's York offices at Foss House on Tuesday and we dived straight into a walkthrough of the timesheeting entry processes. It was a great introduction to the hows and whys of the service (including the historical context), and set us up with a good sense of what we want to investigate over the coming weeks.  

Activities and engagements this week have included:
- Timesheeting walkthrough (Ashley Rex, Field Ops)
- Systems and data landscape (Tim Lewis, David Brown, Adam Locker)
- Finance (Charging) overview (Jeremy Upton, Richard Collier)
- Reviewing user guidance documents
- Breaking down service task / activities 
- Identifying user roles / journey mapping
- Mapping data flow and technology

As we've been talking with different users we're starting to surface some of the headline pain points and opportunities that we need to interrogate further, and especially to validate through user research with remote or plant-based staff and contractors. For example
- Food plant operations and environments present some specific physical, logistical and connectivity challenges for timesheeting, that would need to be addressed outside of the timesheeting application itself 
- It's easy to make mistakes with the design of the user interface
- Approving timesheets is a clunky process, and relies heavily on individual staff knowledge 
- There is little system feedback to users during timesheet entry or submission, which means additional workarounds are put in place (manually and through external systems or exception reports)
- Some data captured may no longer be used or stored
- Some data that is retained may be stored multiple times, at additional cost
- Setting up and onboarding users, especially contractors, is a variable experience that can affect how well they interact with the timesheeting system

From the outset, we've been heartened by the warm welcome we've received, and the openness of the people we've been talking with at the FSA - not only to the discovery process, but also to the potential service and system improvements we may be able to inform. Feedback from the show and tell has been encouraging and is helping us shift and focus attention in the right places. 

## Next week (27-30 Aug)

While some of the timesheet data users are office-based, those who provide or check and approve the timesheets are field-based. Next week we're gearing up for **site visits** (29 Aug, ~~3~~ 4 Sep) to hear from them. 

We'll also be reaching out across the business for participants to join the **service design workshop** (date to be confirmed). [Let us know](http://fsa-timesheeting.herokuapp.com/team) if you'd like to take part, or want to suggest someone who should be there.

Some of the related and other activities we'll be doing next week include: 
- Prepare user interviews and observation sheets for site visits 
- Develop user research survey for engagement groups
- Plan and organise service design workshop 
- Draft service experience journey 
- Map out technology system relationships and pain points
- Engage non-charging backoffice users

As we reach the midpoint of the discovery at the end of week 2, we hope to have a full overview of the systems and data that relate to the timesheeting service; well-defined user segments including key activities; draft user and service experience journeys; have started validating and surfacing pain points and opportunities through field observation and further interviews. 

It's a short week with the bank holiday plus a day out on-site. It's going to be tight pulling together the field research findings with other bits we're working ahead of the [show and tell](http://fsa-timesheeting.herokuapp.com/show-and-tells), but there's sure to be plenty to share and discuss next Friday.
