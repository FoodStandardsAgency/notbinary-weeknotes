# D4:S1 (16/09/19 - 20/09/19)

**Tl;dr**: Getting a handle on the tech side of service | Responsive & supportive FSA team | Secondary user research only | Sketching options next week

## This week

In the second week of our discovery, we’ve deepened our understanding of the various elements of the current service. An initial conversation with Steve and David at GDS gave context to the use of GOV.UK Licensing, and the issues with that, and a view of the day-to-day interactions between users, LAs and GOV.UK. Mark Appleby has supported us running through the blueprint and also with really solid documentation about the RAFB (Register a food business) application that has answered most of our questions.

On the user research side, Layo has been pulling insights from research carried out by IBM for a wider project around 18 months ago. She’s also put together a user research plan that could be carried out in future, to deepen our understanding of FBOs’ and LAs’ experience of the service. One insight was that there are some LA concerns around changes to a system they’re used to; this will need to be handled in our options by clear communication and, as far as possible, no additional burden to the LA team. It’s also been decided that there will be no primary research carried out within this discovery, given the time pressures, the LA time already used for RAFB research, and the existing user research to work from. 

Thanks to those who attended our first Show & Tell on Wednesday ([slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-p1XnMrHrZxwYtKCNElCpUDtzQvVdEbb1BFdNJ_beu0/edit?usp=sharing), recording to come). We’re pleased to say it ran fairly smoothly tech-wise, mostly thanks to learning what didn’t work from other ongoing discoveries between Notbinary and the FSA. This point also came up in our retrospective – there are certainly advantages to sharing learnings across the teams. The retrospective also highlighted the positive working relationship between the FSA and Notbinary teams; we have been particularly grateful for the team’s responsiveness and their direct, timely feedback.

## Next week
By the end of week three of this discovery, we intend to have our options sketched out in order to allow time for sharing and discussion during our fourth week with the FSA team. To enable this, we’ll need to put together all the puzzle pieces of technology – GOV.UK, FSA site, RAFB application, LA, etc. We’re planning to talk to FSS, to understand how they use the GOV.UK routing, and Civica, to validate our understanding of the RAFB system and support, and to consider future options. Our product owner Sally will support with knowledge of the FSA site.

Alongside the tech deep dive, we’ll be drafting some other recommendations to accompany the technical options, touching on content, user support, and further user research. We’ll collate what we’ve found on how many LAs are using each route and what that means for the move.  

We’ll have our **second Show & Tell at 12 noon on Wednesday 25th**, where we intend to share that technical view, as well as the considerations that should be made when choosing the right option for the service. Please do join us remotely on [https://whereby.com/fsa-rafb](https://whereby.com/fsa-rafb) – I’ll confirm whether we have a physical space early next week.
