# D10:S1 (02/03/20 - 05/03/20)

## This week

The team have commenced the new discovery well.  

After a couple of days orientating ourselves to the new world of SFBB (the core team also just finished the Food Allergy Reporting Discovery at the end of last week), we had had a great kick off session with all the key stakeholders. 

Key points covered were:

* Introducing the team and stakeholder group
* Ensure clarity on what we are here to do
* Talk through roles, responsibilities and ways of working
* Plus, we also discussed and agreed core service users and stakeholders for us to target as part of our research

Crucially (and thankfully!) all attendees agreed that the scope of this discovery is 'to explore the existing SFBB service, end to end, to understand the existing user experience and how it can be improved'. 

Rohela led the team through a workshop to help provide the Notbinary team members with an understanding of the business context including business requirements. 

Key areas we covered in this workshop were:

* Understanding the problem space 
* FSA’s users including expectations 
* Communication 
* Process 
* Success measures 

Kudos goes to FSA team members - Sandra, Lisa and David - all of whom have been extremely helpful in ensuring the NotBinary crew can move quickly. 

## Next week

Research is the central spine of any discovery, so it's important to get a solid research plan agreed early doors. Sue and Rohela will devising a plan early next week to do this. It will then need to agreed by Sandra and other members of the FSA representatives in the discovery team. 

We'll then rapidly start arranging interviews and all the supporting material e.g. interview guides to help us start the user research in earnest as quickly as possible. We have a great deal to cover in a short period of time. 

Alison will also be joining the team as of next week to provide additional user research support and expertise.
