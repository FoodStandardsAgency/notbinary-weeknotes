# D7:S3 (16/12/19 - 20/12/19)

## This week

Most of the this week has been spent speaking to more users and stakeholders. Over the last five days we have spoken to:

- Consumers
- Consumer groups, including Allergy UK, Anaphylaxis Campaign and Allergy Action
- Retailers and food outlets, including Tescos and Byron
- More local authorities from England, Wales and Northern Ireland
- Members of the FSA community with a strong interest in allergens

In addition, Rohela visited Barnsley where they have been conducting a pilot into reporting allergic reactions to food. 

The other major output from this week is the creation of a survey that we will be publishing shortly aimed at members of the public who are living with allergies (or care for someone living with them). We are hoping that the survey will provide us with a healthy number of responses from actual users to augment the one to one interviews with have been doing this week with users. The survey will cover a number of themes with users, including:  

* Motivations about reporting
* Understanding behaviours from past reporting
* Understanding their awareness re. ability to report
* Attitudes to reporting reactions from different food types
* Feelings about sharing personal data


## Next week

Our next working week will be w/c 6th January 2020. Fortunately we have been able to complete most our user research this side of Xmas, but there will be two or three 'mop up' interviews we have booked early in the new year. 

Our main focus when we return after the Xmas break will be to analyse and reflect on all the interviews and research we have been doing over the last three weeks, drawing out insights and trends. The team have booked a couple of 'off site' days to allow us to do this in a dedicated space - so expect large amounts of caffeine and biscuits to be consumed! 

Have a great Xmas break and see you all in 2020.
