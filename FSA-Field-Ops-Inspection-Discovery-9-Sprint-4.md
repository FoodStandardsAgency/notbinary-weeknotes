## This week (17-21 Feb)

We continue our tour of official controls with a closer look at Unannounced Inspections (UAI). The team have been diving into the Manual of Official Controls, the formal and informal systems being used and a series of interviews with frontline staff, including UAI leads, meat inspectors and veterinary coordinators. 

As we go through this we've been building up a picture of the service flow, personas of the actors involved, the core user journeys within and around the inspection lifecycle, as well as the range of tooling that enables delivery. 

We're getting a clearer sense and validation of the commonalities with the Dairy and Audit processes. Leaving aside the detail and domain knowledge specifics, the before-during-after pattern is consistent, and the remit and purpose of the services are clear and consistent with the FSA mission. 

The differences and adjacencies are perhaps more interesting. 

There is a complex interaction between the audit and UAI cycles. Minimum requirements are predictable, but follow up visits and actions are frequent, and this can (and invariably does) throw a curve ball at the best laid plans. 

This complexity is further complicated with trying to organise and coordinate visits. There are more variable factors and actors involved in this domain than Dairy, which feels more operationally consolidated. 

Underlying this may be a misalignment between the operational ambition (to add value to the audit process through unannounced inspections) and the organisational structures to support this.  Borrowing people across teams makes it much harder to coordinate. An emergency in the borrowed space can have a domino effect for unannounced inspections. Operations are finely balanced in this regard. 

The work that UAI inspectors do occasionally folds in other incidents and complaints. This is useful and opportunistic to reduce the footfall impact for food business operators (FBOs) - as well as FSA costs - but these adjacencies are often conflated. While the work is done by UAI inspectors, it isn't necessarily within the scope of UAI (insofar is that supports and adds value to the audit process).  This masks the volume and efficacy of the work being done, and makes it harder to predict the scale of operations that needs to be accommodated. 

We're continuing to observe digital literacy challenges in the core userbase, which are compounded by multiple or ambiguous names for systems and tools that are regularly used.  Exacerbating this is a lack of version management, particularly for informally developed tools. 

The UAI space has turned out to be much more complicated than we anticipated, and the team are making a concerted effort to improve their internal standards and protocols. Consistent and user-focussed digital tools will help, but inevitably some of the challenges reach beyond the scope of technology.  

Finally, it's worth saying that the impacts on consistency raise questions for us on the FBO experience of the service. We're not able to get access to them in this discovery process and timeframe, but they have a voice that is worth listening to. Tied in with this is the question of how the FSA positions its role to support FBOs to meet official controls standards, which again, takes us back to strategic intention around the vision operating model. 


## Next week (24-28 Feb)

Attention turns to Wine inspection and we will continue with user interviews, guidance and tooling reviews to understand more about this area of official controls. This is supplemented by a site visit on Tuesday. 

Also on Tuesday we have an Unannounced Inspection visit, which will help put into context the findings from this week. 

Some of the team are out at various points during the week, so this will constrain how much we can synthesise ahead of the next show and tell. To make the most of that, we'll likely defer some of the writeup to the following week, when we will be taking a deeper look at the similarities and differences across domains
