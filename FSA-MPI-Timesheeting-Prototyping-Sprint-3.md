# This week (14-18 Oct)

Our first few weeks on Timesheeting have been mostly about "discovery through research", and this phase could be characterised as "discovery through prototyping". As the designs we've been working on take shape, iterate and get extended, it's been much easier to get a sense of how the service (and not just the Timesheeting app) does and could work. The process of putting them together challenges us into thinking deeper about how system and user intention can become better aligned. 

It's not as simple as saying that a picture paints a thousand words. The prototype designs draw out and test user needs and expectations more viscerally than a verbal description. This week we've extended the activity logging to incorporate planned absences, and are folding in the dashboard entry points too. 

The visuals take the ideas we're exploring out of our heads and allow us to have the next level of conversations with users that we need to build a better and shared understanding of what's needed of the service - especially when it opens up conversations borne from disagreement. The feedback we've been getting around the user interface changes has been encouraging. It's not all perfect, as we have to almost reinvent some aspects in order to address other challenges - a more usable mobile friendly interface, for example, means changing how data is captured. There's a delicate balance between making it sufficiently different to meet new constraints without being a jarring shift.

Delving deeper into assets like the Single Information Repository this week, we're defining clearer pathways for aligning the front-end and platform architecture in a modern way that should meet the security and platform constraints identified last week. Disaggregating applications and improving data management and communication across applications builds the foundations for the longer-term opportunities, while also unlocking the door for downstream enhancements and integrations with systems such as Statements of Resource and rotas, neither of which are currently well positioned to drive Timesheeting.  

Joining the design and architecture pieces together is the supporting analysis. This week has been focused on elaborating the user stories that articulate what behaviour and functionality is expected of the system. From this we've started to develop a scorecard to help compare the current application with the prototype ideas - ensuring that existing functionality and business outcomes aren't lost. The scorecard can also be used to help identify the next-stage of design focus, as well as help inform any future extended prototyping work. 

# Next week (21-25 Oct)

We'll be bringing this phase of work to a close over the next few days. Key tasks include: 
* Iterate data entry prototypes to full journey context, incorporating notifications and user feedback
* Elaborate prototyping scorecard and user stories
* Analysis of SIR information 
* Test workability of tech direction with Infrastructure and Security

On Tuesday the Digital Super Users and ITLs are reconvening for a final walkthrough and review of the designs so far (though we'll continue to welcome feedback beyond then). We're looking forward to seeing how they respond to the end-to-end journey designs before presenting the prototypes to the project's SRO on Thursday in Birmingham. 

There's no Show & Tell next Friday (25 Oct). Instead, we'll be reconvening for that on Tue 29 Oct at Foss House in York, followed by a retrospective and our first service assessment with the FSA. That's a welcome opportunity for the FSA and Notbinary team to review the work done, test that the Discovery phase has delivered what it set out to, and take a step back to ask: are we doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time?
