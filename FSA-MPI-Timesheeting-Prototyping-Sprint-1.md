# This week (30 Sep-4 Oct)

The last few days have been transitioning the team from Discovery mode to a prototyping phase for the Timesheeting service. Over the next three weeks, we'll be exploring and testing assumptions and risks around (1) improving the user experience and (2) addressing remote access issues.

A big step towards gearing up for this has been been bringing on board interaction designer Jonno Witts. He'll be leading on devising and sketching up possible user flows, interactions and interfaces, generating the prototyping artefacts that we'll circulate for feedback. At this stage, we're not expecting to design a finished solution, but to focus on key interaction pain points in the pivotal stages of the service, and to test out different ways that they could be met. 

We had an initial session with three Field Ops members of the FSA's Digital Super Users community to understand how we could work together to get feedback on any proposed designs. As members of the IT Training group, they've got a solid grasp of the digital needs and capabilities of frontline staff. That adds a valuable dimension to our design process. We've got limited contact time with this team because of their day-to-day operational commitments, but we have scheduled key sessions next week and a fortnight later for group feedback. We're also working with a cohort of Inspection Team Leaders from across the country, which will especially help with prototyping for individual timesheet review and plant-wide reconciliation against expected activity. 

As well as mobilising our prototype working group, we've also been diving deeper into the data flows of the Timesheeting system, enlisting support from Finance, Field Ops and IT to understand where specific data fields come from and how it's used. There's more to interrogate around reporting, but these initial steps are important to make sure that any new designs we model still capture the data needed to deliver the business outcomes expected of the service - particularly around paying and charging for inspection controls, but also to support operations management. 

The Show and Tell this week was a really useful forum, and we had great feedback and challenge from all who participated, which is definitely helping us better shape our approach and priorities for the next few weeks. We really appreciate the constructive engagement. 

# Next week (7-11 Oct)

We have two goals next week: 
1. Begin prototyping feedback process
2. Validate security needs vs proposed access model and architecture

To this end, we've lined up a kick-off session with the Digital Super Users and ITLs, as well as reviews of the Statement of Resource system with IT and Finance. 

Key tasks for the week are to
* Map out possible user and interaction flows for timesheet input
* Elaborate priority timesheet entry scenarios for prototyping
* Circulate initial prototype sketches for feedback
* Review Timesheeting database model
* Develop scorecard to measure prototype against service design criteria

By the end of the week we should have a fuller understanding of the information architecture and security constraints, and - perhaps more exciting - some designs in the hands of users that we can iterate from.
