**Tl;dr**: Options are sketched out | Now working on tech detail, financials & timings | Some outstanding conversations with GDS, FSS and Civica | Final presentation next week

# This week
We started our third week of discovery with a brainstorming session in Aviation House, sketching out the options available to the FSA for the food business registration service. This helped us identify the outstanding questions we needed to resolve, both within this four weeks and beyond. We believe there are some fairly ‘light touch’ options that could improve the experience for the food business operator user and would be low cost for the FSA. 

Tuesday saw a brief interlude for Paul and Lucy, joining DDaT at a workshop with Matt Thompson exploring how the team is currently working, where improvements could be made and [‘working open’](https://workopen.org/). We enjoyed putting some faces to names and gaining a better understanding of the team’s strengths and challenges, as well as picking up a few takeaways for Notbinary.

At our second all-remote Show & Tell ([slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i6SYbbaMQPyg5a18kewsDU4zVcnqfr1_wlhJhXxEUtg/edit?usp=sharing)), we shared what we’d learnt from GDS and secondary research about how the service works now and what changes might be coming. The team were able to support with some of the outstanding questions, such as confirming that the ‘How to change’ section of the GOV.UK service isn’t the channel used for FBOs making changes to business details, and that the use of a reference number generator within RAFB is still under discussion. The team also gave us guidance about what they’re expecting to see in our final Show & Tell next week. We spoke to GDS on Thursday and confirmed their plans for the Licensing service which has further shaped our options. 

Sally reviewed our options slides this morning and the feedback was to add more detail on the technology that is currently used to provide each service function, how reusable it might be, and the potential costs & implementation times of each option. We’ll be making these updates today and on Monday in time to share with stakeholders in the first half of next week. 

# Next week
As well as continuing to shape our options exploration based on the feedback we receive from the team, we have a few meetings to wind up before the end of our discovery:
- David from GDS is venturing to Aviation House to run us through the workings of the LA ‘admin area’ that sits behind GOV.UK Licensing
- We’ll be talking to FSS to confirm Scottish LAs’ use of the GOV.UK PDF route and any plans they have in the pipeline
- Civica will be confirming the details of the current RAFB technology and any scope for future changes

We’ll then be completing the Discovery wiki, including everything we’ve learnt about the ‘as is’ service and technology. We’ll have a closed **final Show & Tell at 12 noon on Wednesday 2nd**, where will share the options & recommendations with the core stakeholder team.
