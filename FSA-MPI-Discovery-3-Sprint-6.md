# This week (20-27 Sep)

We've mostly been wrapping up loose ends and polishing the research outputs this week, as we draw a line under the discovery phase. 

The service blueprint has been updated following the all-hands review from last week, and supporting research has been elaborated, particularly around constraints and metrics. We're really grateful for the feedback we received to make it so comprehensive and accurate, and for the response it's had from users as a living reference document.

The technology recommendations playback and review went really well. There's a good appetite for the approach we've suggested of using timesheeting as an entry point to longer range digital transformation. As these kinds of change can impact (and be impacted by) multiple projects and services across the agency, a regular working group is planned to convene to ensure good alignment and awareness across the broader discovery programme. 

The wiki has been further updated with a reference section to help make it easier for anyone picking up a future prototyping to get quickly up to speed and navigate the research findings and source materials.  That should help with keeping the pace and momentum we've managed to build during discovery.

This week we also got to run the full discovery retrospective, covering the entire project process. There are some practical actions to take at project level (and we've already started applying some of those, such as to how Show & Tells run), as well as portfolio-wide considerations. The details are on the [project wiki](https://fsa-timesheeting.herokuapp.com/retrospectives), along with previous weekly retro summaries.  

What's been most encouraging from it though is the continued and renewed sense of one team working together - right across IT, Finance, Field Ops, FSA Digital and Notbinary - to make timesheeting a better service for everyone whose jobs are affected by it. We've all worked hard to be open and build trust, and that shared culture has helped get us to a really good place at the end of Discovery.

# What happens next

Subject to getting the green light, we'd be looking at transitioning to early prototyping: 
* Identifying and engaging key working group members
* Scheduling workshops and regular meetings for project duration
* Defining prototyping hypotheses
* Reviewing and visualising data flow 

This would build on the discovery findings and recommendations, laying the groundwork for exploring ways to show how timesheeting entry and review could look and behave, against the existing constraints of the underlying data model, ongoing reporting needs and prevailing technology stack.
