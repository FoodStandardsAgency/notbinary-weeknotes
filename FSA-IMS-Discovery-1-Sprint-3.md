**Tl;dr**: [Service experience blueprint](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/service-experience-blueprint) drafted | [Technology](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/technology-overview) and [data flows](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/data-flow) mapped out | [User segments](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/user-segments) finalised and needs being analysed for early insights | Show & tell: [Slides](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/irs-discovery-show-&-tell-3.pdf) & [Video](https://vimeo.com/351592608).

## This week
As we close off sprint 3, we reach the halfway point of the discovery. The week has flown by with some great collaborative sessions that have helped us get to a solid baseline understanding of the service and it's core users. We had another couple more big sessions this week. First, we had a second [service experience blueprint](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/service-experience-blueprint) session where we used the output from last week, normalised it somewhat and played it back to a few key users. This helped drive some of our thinking around who the users of the service _really_ are (vs. internal and external service providers).

The second session was focussed on the [technology](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/technology-overview) and [data flows](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/data-flow) across the service. This was another highly collaborative session and thanks to all those that took part (as it was long one!). This has allowed the team to get the full view of all systems being used and data flowing through them. This is an essential foundation for making recommendations and identifying opportunities to explore in the Alpha.

The user research soldiers on. We're up to **27 interviews** conducted with more being lined up as I type. We do recognise that the research to date has been a bit internally focused so we'll be working hard to address that over the next 2 sprints. A couple bits of clear early insights from the research this week:
- **Email is used heavily** across the service to manage incidents. There
is concern about the **limited traceability, visibility of status, search**
**capability and comprehensive audit trail** this provides
- Each team **tracks incidents statistics**. The method used are **time**
**consuming and localised** to their team

This might not be surprising information but it's good to see this coming out the research and we'll be periodically publishing the [findings](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/user-segments) for people to see.

And finally, **Kudos** goes out this week to Beth for her awesome stakeholder wrangling skills and Abi for her insightful show & tell slot.

## Next week
Inevitably, things will start picking up pace now as we begin to solidify themes, identify trends and start to test out our recommendations for moving into the Alpha. We've got quite a bit planned:
- Deep dive into the legislation and policy that drives the service
- Analysis and overlays of the service blueprint with volumes and metrics
- Loads more user and stakeholder interviews (hopefully loaded more towards external users)
- Meetings with some of the other FSA operational leads to get their take on things
- Draft a Privacy Impact Assessment so we get ahead of the curve for the latter Alpha stage when we start playing with some prototype tech
- Holding a mid-point review session to playback findings and emerging thinking with the core team

The team remain in good spirits. We've had a few blockers raised at stand-ups for 'lack of time' but we're confident we can keep on track and bring things home within the next 3 weeks. 

Our goal for the end of next week is to have the majority of the research conducted and analysed so we can move to shaping the recommendations in sprint 5... [Onward!](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/08/03/onwards/)
