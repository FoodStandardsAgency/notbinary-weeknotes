## This week (27-31 Jan)

It's the first week back in York for the [team](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fieldops-inspections/wiki/team), and we've dived straight into a new discovery exploring the commonalities around Field Ops Inspections. Previously we've explored [timesheeting](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-timesheeting/wiki) and [resourcing](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki) for ongoing inspection work within meat plants. This time we're looking across food domains: 

* Dairy Inspections
* Wine Inspections
* Meat Inspections (unannounced visits only)

We've been building up a picture of each of these activity areas with initial braindump sessions with Leads from each respective area, supplemented with some background reading to scan the scope area. At this point we've filled the walls of our space in Mallard House with post-its covering the why, who, what, where and when for each area, as well as the key tools, inputs and outputs of the processes.

It's apparent that there's a lot of research that's already happened with these parts of Field Ops, as well as a lot of operational activity currently underway. With this in mind we've been forming a discovery approach that allows us to considerately reach the users we need to in the time available within.

If at all feasible, we're aiming to focus research effort across each of our workstreams on one domain each week, and incrementally build up the picture of opportunities to simplify, standardise and share tooling. That gives us a clear point of consolidation and synthesis around Week 6, with a bit of time to do any necessary follow-up interviews (or indirect research) while finalising and validating the service blueprint.

It's very early days, but it does appear that there are some clear candidates for service improvement. These are shaping up as hypotheses to test out as we progress our research efforts over the next few weeks, and against which to build an evidence base.

## Next week (3-7 Feb)

There's a huge amount of background information to absorb across dairy, wine and unannounced meat inspections. Next week is essential to get a handle on what the Manual for Official Controls tells us about what should be happening, so we can make best use of the limited time we'll have with users to validate their needs against, and to start better understanding tooling equivalents in each domain. 

There's going to be a lot of diary wrangling to line up the user and stakeholder interviews that will keep us occupied over the next month.  Already scheduled is a review of the strategic context with the SLA team, which will help us set this discovery against the FSA's existing portfolio and vision.  

We're starting up again with Show & Tells next week as well, so looking forward to sharing plans and impressions with the Field Ops and Digital community.
