# D7:S8 (03/02/20 - 07/02/20)

## Last week

We met with the Industry Exchange Group - a community of food business operators (FBOs) including Pret, Greggs, Nandos and Dominos. Partly a relationship building opportunity (particularly for any potential Alpha work), this was a good opportunity for the team to probe a bit deeper into the FBO-related findings from Phase One. Main points of interest were:

* Incidents of allergic food reporting is a significant growth area
* The group recognise that food allergies are a very complex area, particularly when determining how best to respond to someone who is living with an intolerance versus a serious allergy
* All of the FBOs present have their own individual reporting mechanism in place 
* They felt the FSA should be at the forefront of educating consumers and increasing awareness about food allergies

We learned from the user survey in Phase One that many people living with a food allergy don't know that they can or where to report to or even that they are able to do so.  So a big theme for us to explore in Phase Two is discoverability i.e. how can the FSA make sure that any new reporting service is easy for potential users to find? 

We've been exploring how the FSA can improve both its search engine rankings and click through success rate to help people discover their online services. This is something other government agencies are now taking more seriously. A really important tool commonly used is called schema mark up - this is additional code that is added to a web page to help search engines understand what the page is all about.You can read more about this [here](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/schemas.html)


## Next week

This week we started conducting impact assessments against each of the possible options to support a reporting solution - currently nine variations. This is quite a long process. For each of the options, we have to think about how each one would play out against a number of different elements, including:

* Development considerations
* Maintenance considerations
* Data standardisation
* Data quality
* GDPR + data security
* Discoverability and awareness
* Cost 
* FSA control (ownership)
* Ability to provide FSA metrics
* Considerations for/impact on a potential investigation aspects, including reporting on outcomes to users
* Consumer trust / legitimacy
* Anonymity considerations
* Multichannel opportunities
* Impact on local authorities 

Ultimately, we will be seeking to assess how well each option meets the needs of users, the FSA and local authorities. We'll be continuing this work through next week.

Additional work we'll be undertaking includes:

* Testing data requirements to wider stakeholders
* Start creating an epic user story
* Widen out the discoverability considerations to FSA ODD community i.e. how can the learnings from this Discovery be applied to other FSA online services
* Look at the options for the ‘non-reporting’ data collections routes e.g. conducting an annual survey with users to get information
