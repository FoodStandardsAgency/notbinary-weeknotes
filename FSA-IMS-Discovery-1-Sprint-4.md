## This week

Having got over the mid-point hump of the discovery, we held a review session with the heads of service to playback the pain point themes we've found from the research and analysis. Here are the headlines:
- Service providers **can’t collaborate efficiently**.
- There is some **duplication of effort** within the service.
- Internal service providers **manually process** large amounts of data.
- **Sharing information** isn’t always straight forward.
- Users are spending time **chasing incomplete or missing information**.
- Internal service providers have to **manually search** for data.
- It is difficult to know the **correct status** of any given incident.
- Some internal users don’t feel part of a **single, joined up service**.

The session was really productive and it was good to see there was a lot of agreement from the representatives of the service. It's clear to see there's a strong **data** theme emerging that underpins a large amount of pain within the service. Understanding these pain points will act as the foundation for the recommendations we make and what we might explore in an [Alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works). 

We have also started to draft the emerging opportunities we will consider the enhancements to the service, based on user needs. These are:
- Establish a single source of truth for core data the service uses/manages
- Incidents should be automatically added to the same case file and stored in the same place
- Having a clear overview (summary) of an incident at any given time
- An easy way to search for incident related data
- Standardise communication in and out of the service
- Automated integration with other systems
- Introduce enhanced reporting capability, with automated status tracking

Interviews with additional users and stakeholders continue. We've made a big push this week to set up more sessions with external service users to ensure we get good representation in our research. Thanks to everyone jumping on this, we've got a decent amount of sessions lined up for next week.

We managed to grab some time with the other FSA operational leads to understand more about how the service interacts with the other key operational services the agency delivers. All the research is being rationalised, consolidated and written up as I type so we'll be starting to see the final artefacts emerge next week.

On the tech & data side of things, we have mostly analysed and documented all the systems and data flows across the service. Lots of validation sessions held this week so expect to see final versions of those being published early next week (if not sooner!).

And finally, **Kudos** goes out this week to Lloyd for running a great Zendesk session, Richard for pulling together the legislation overview, Paul for getting us access to guest Wi-Fi at Clive House and Paul & Beth for helping us find external service users to interview.

## Next week
We've got a really busy week coming up for the team. The headlines are: 
- Complete user research with external service providers and service users
- Create ‘full service’ pain points and opportunities view
- Deep dive into legislation and policy
- Enriching the evidence for our insights and findings with volumes and metrics
- Deepen our understanding of CLUE and CLIO systems
- Draft Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- Working up discovery options for final report
- Spend some more time with Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland contingents to validate our findings

Our goal for the end of next week is to complete the research and analysis, as well as, get the majority of it written up so we can start to playback key recommendations in the final sprint (6). 

This is going to keep the team **very** busy so we'll need to provide the team with tactical deployments of healthy* snacks throughout the week (*and probably some less healthy ones too).
