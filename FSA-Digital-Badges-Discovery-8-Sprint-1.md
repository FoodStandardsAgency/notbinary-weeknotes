# D8:S1 (27/01/20 - 31/01/20)

**This week**

The team Ema, Zoe and Paul travelled to Cardiff to meet Jayne, the FSA product owner. This first week was all about gathering information, learning and lining up stakeholder interview sessions. 
We met with Wendy to learn all about the process of new food business registration through to the issuing of a food hygiene rating. We took what we learnt and created a digital service map 
Ema met with James (FSA technical contact) and received information on the currently available APIs at the FSA, however these are not related to the previous digital badges. Will review these with Carbs as part of our data and technical considerations.

We managed to get hold of the FSA brand guidelines and will be setting up a call soon with the team responsible. 

There has also a been a lot of reading to do this week, including quite a bit of previous research carried out by the FSA

**Next week**

Next week will involve a lot of information gathering from stakeholders: 
* Ema will be arranging a meeting with Una and Mark to discuss previous research from Northern Ireland. 
* Zoe will be meeting with Bronagh to discuss work already underway with food delivery aggregators, such as Justeat
* Zoe will also meet Tom, who has been working on a project that aims to automate detection of online food hygiene scores
* Paul will be meeting each of the policy leads for England, Wales and Northern Ireland to discuss the legal and policy landscape of FHRS and any roadmap items that might have an impact on this discovery.
