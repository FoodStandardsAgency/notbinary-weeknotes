# This week

Early this week we visited the team at Epimorphics in Bristol to learn about their findings in the context of Unified View and, more generally, the Regulating Our Future initiative. They flagged that during their user research they hadn’t been able to speak to LAs in Wales or a London borough so we have prioritised that in our research plan. They were able to walk us through the various methods in which data is currently provided to the FSA by LAs, and the pain points in the current process.

We also received some of the advice that FSA lawyers have provided on the FSA’s legal position around acquiring and/or viewing data that currently sits with LAs in order to fulfil its responsibilities. We intend to start playing back our understanding of the legal situation on Tuesday.

Our Friday has been spent with a dozen representatives of the RCD who generously came to London for the day to discuss their data requirements. They’ve given us some context on projects that are already in the works in this space. We learnt that:
* Teams at the FSA can spend months following up on, validating and cleaning data received from Local Authorities before it can be used in decision making
* The difficulties in mapping various data sets against each other means that the RCD aren’t always confident in the accuracy of the information
* For data that is returned on a yearly basis, the information that is being used can be from over a year ago, preventing the team from prioritising what’s important now
We also talked about the the potential benefits for LAs and the FSA, and the need for unique establishment identifiers in data sharing. 

# Next week 

Next week, we will start by processing everything we learnt on Friday and following up on the documents mentioned. We’re hoping to arrange conversations with an MIS provider(s) and Food Standards Scotland, and to improve our understanding of UV with a demo. 

Layo will be kicking off user research with some additional considerations raised on Friday, such as talking to an LA that is more technology enabled, for example by using tablet devices to capture information in the field.

Our first **Show & Tell will be on Tuesday 11-12** – I’ll confirm the call method on Monday. We intend to share our user research plan and initial legal understanding.
