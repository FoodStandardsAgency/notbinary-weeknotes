**Tl;dr**: Recommendations for prototyping UX & content for the food business registration flow have been presented to digital and business teams | Some continued conversations with LAs and GDS required | Wiki & Google Drive written up

# This week
Our fourth week of discovery has concentrated on sharing our findings and resulting recommendations with the digital and business teams at the FSA. 

One particular finding from GDS about plans for Licensing has changed the thinking around what work needs to be done by the FSA. GOV.UK provides information pages and postcode routing to direct food business operators to the relevant Local Authority in order to complete their food business registration. This will continue to be the case – no matter the changes to Licensing or, indeed, other services on GOV.UK – as it is one of the responsibilities sitting with GOV.UK under the EU Services Directive.

As a result, our final recommendations for the FSA focus on prototyping content and UX design to create a joined-up, straightforward journey for a user beginning their experience on GOV.UK and completing the transaction on RAFB and, where possible, to increase digital uptake of the RAFB application. We advise against rebuilding either the routing functionality or the PDF route provided by GOV.UK, given that there is no clear user need. Additionally, the PDF route is inaccessible for many users and would require a new build and ongoing support. 

In between these sessions, we’ve spoken to:

David from **GDS**, who gave us a run-through of how the Licensing ‘admin area’ works
- For the ‘as is’ service, David shared which links LAs were using for their FBOs; users are directed to the GOV.UK PDF route for around 75% of LAs, followed by 17% to the LA site, and 8% to RAFB.
- We learnt that there are two user types: ‘operator’ and ‘administrator’. The operators are the day-to-day users who can download flattened PDFs from the ‘admin area’, while the administrators are responsible for updating LAs’ contact details and payment accounts, customising forms and assigning different forms/licences to different teams within the LA. 
- This requires user account management – users’ accounts are frozen after 90 days of inactivity. While this rarely happens for operators, it can happen for administrators who update LA details and perhaps audit the forms maybe once a year. 

The technical lead at **Civica**, who was able to confirm our understanding of the RAFB technology and sign-up process for local authorities. 
- We learnt that the user’s progress in the RAFB form is stored for 24 hours if they use the same browser, allowing them to come back to questions.
- We also learnt that all LA users, no matter if they are signed up to the integrated or non-integrated route, will receive a PDF copy of the user’s registrations to the relevant mailbox when they are notified. 
The sign-up process for LAs on the non-integrated route should be low effort and straightforward; they provide an email address and then ask GDS to update the link to the RAFB one. RAFB will use a unique URL per LA and it’s quick to set up. 

Bryan Campbell and Lorna Murray from Food Standards Scotland (**FSS**) who both went through how food business operators register in Scotland. 
- We learnt that all 32 LAs in Scotland have their own method of registration, with most being through the submission of a completed non-digital form. 
- We also learnt that there are only three Management Information Systems (MIS) in Scotland all of which send weekly reports to FSS, and that all 32 LAs have data sharing agreements with FSS. 

Once we’ve completed our write-up, Paul and Lucy will be joining the DDaT team at their away day in Birmingham on Friday which will be an enjoyable way to round off this discovery and a great springboard for the next ones. If anyone would like access to the documentation for this discovery, please get in touch with Alison Saunders or Sally Barber who will be able to share links & logins for our Wiki and Google Drive as appropriate.
