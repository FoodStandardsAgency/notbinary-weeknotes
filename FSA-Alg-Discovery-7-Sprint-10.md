# D7:S10 (17/02/20 - 21/02/20)

## This week

The team have now completed our impact assessment of all the eight options, as mentioned in the previous week note. 

Critically, we worked through these options with FSA-team members to ensure they agreed with our initial draft responses. I'm happy to report that some changes were made very cordially (no blood was spilt!) then we collectively rag rated each option as to how well they met:

* User needs
* FSA needs
* LA needs

In reality, any option needs to meet the needs of all three groups to be seriously considered as an Alpha candidate. We'll be sharing the outputs from all the assessment work as part of our final report next week.  

Sue, our UX Lead, has also now started creating some design sketches to help illustrate how a potential tool might look. This isn't a detailed design, more indicative at this stage. But it provides a flavour of what might be possible. 

## Next week

We will concluding all the Discovery work (both Phase One and Two) next week, so it will be an intense few days. We've already started working on the final report, which we will be presenting to the project sponsors in Cardiff on Thursday, then to the wider stakeholder group on Friday. 

Areas we will be covering in the report are:

* What we’ve done in Phase 2
* Business requirements
* Data considerations
* Service design principles
* Important factors to consider:
* * Discoverability
* * Report a Food Problem
* * IRU
* * Local Authorities
* Impact assessment of each option
* Recommendations
* Design sketches
* Alpha considerations
* Next steps

Hopefully we will see you all next Friday 28th at 1000 for the final Show and Tell!
