## This week (4-8 Nov)

We've had an intensive week of planning, coordination and background research to roll straight from one discovery ([Timesheeting](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-weeknotes/wiki#meat-plant-inspections)) into Inspection Resourcing - focusing on the workflows and tools that sit around Statements of Resource and rotas to support meat plant inspections. 

* **Planning** to 
  * get Field Ops interviews lined up (**kudos to Shaun Gleadle** and his team for sterling work on that front)
  * tee up backoffice and external stakeholders 
  * ensure we have space to work over the coming weeks (including a room for Show and Tell invitees), and to 
  * lock in key end of project milestones, such as final show and tell and service assessment.
* **Coordination** 
  * making sure that user research, service analysis and interaction design leads are well aligned, so that we can make the best use of the limited time we have with users and stakeholders before Christmas peak hits hard
  * establishing a coherent suite of research questions that help quickly understand the user and business needs 
* **Background research** 
  * diving into key guidance documents (particularly for Statements of Resource and contracts) that will inform our lines of enquiry 
  * making sure the new members of the team are brought up to speed with context of inspection management and timesheeting that have led to this discovery. 
  * reviewing existing systems

On that score, the delivery team has expanded slightly - and we welcome Lowri Davies as our new User Researcher. The [Notbinary Discovery approach](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vqOPj6VvJPT3jbkbNJtquYxVcnXtCu-Phz90CWW-c3c/edit#slide=id.g6ae930ce00_0_174) puts user research up front (along with service analysis) and she's been doing a great job getting up to speed - the rest of the team has 1-2 months headstart.  

The [Timesheeting prototyping handover](FSA-MPI-Timesheeting-Prototyping-Sprint-4) we did for FSA Digital played a part in setting up the context here. Scoping sessions with the Product Owner and sponsor, as well as a rota planning walkthrough and initial conversation with the SLA team have also helped with grounding the team around the focus of this discovery. 

Over the next six weeks - through a combination of research and prototyping - we seek to:
* understand how SOR and rota fit into inspection management workflow
* examine what data is captured and how it is used
* examine accuracy and consistency of SOR and rota tools 
* understand what the resourcing tools don’t support or enable

This will allow us to discover the potential and limits to drive integrated timesheeting, SOR and rotas, and ultimately further test the ambition to realise "[timesheeting by exception](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qUDSXveYpHuk_gFM2yqSP3tp-SvKpRcryThoixaiNzc/edit#slide=id.g4784c6f874_0_642)" as a model for a more accurate and efficient inspection management service. 

## Next week (11-15 Nov)

Understanding the user experience and service context will be our main focus over this sprint week. The diary is full of interviews lined up with Team Leaders and Area Managers, some of which will spill over into next week. We'll start building up a rich view of who the users are, how they work with resourcing tools and what their needs are. 

The insights we gather will also help us start understanding the service flow and constraints. As common pain points emerge, we'll begin identifying areas we may need to drill into or test further in coming weeks. 

We'll continue to do desk research and build up the stakeholder map, ahead of lining up further interviews, particularly with stakeholders outside of Field Ops and beyond the FSA. 

Alongside this, we'll explore design patterns around rota and resourcing systems, which will help inform our prototyping approach further downstream. In anticipation of that we're also sketching out some of the code and data interfaces that are likely needed to support integration of SOR, rotas and timesheets, so that we can hit the ground running for the second phase of discovery.
