# This week

Layo, Tim and Lucy have kicked off a short discovery with Sally Barber into the Report a Food Problem service. This service, provided by the FSA digital team, enables consumers to report issues with food to the appropriate body. The issues we’re concentrating on here are the ones which are forwarded to Local Authorities: food poisoning, food product issues, and food safety and hygiene practices. 

We started our discovery by reviewing the surveys and known issues that have already been collected by the digital team. 
* **Local Authorities**: Local Authorities have raised some pain points with the reports they receive, including issues with invalid email addresses or lack of complaint detail preventing them from following up, and malicious or false complaints taking up time. 
* **Consumers**: there isn't much research into consumers' experience of the service, but it's known that in some cases they receive misleading and/or inconsistent messaging. For example, they may be informed that their report has been forwarded to the relevant authority where in fact it has failed to send. 
* **FSA digital team**: the main issue faced by the FSA digital team is the time taken up by 'failed to send' reports. These are mostly linked to an issue matching the address entered by a consumer with a relevant Local Authority. 

Sally gave us a run-through of the system and Anna Nikiel answered some of our more technical questions around how the system is set up and any logging that takes place.

# Next week

Next week we'll share where we're up to so far with Sally as well as the LA relationship managers we've spoken to. We intend to prioritise some of the known problems with the service and start considering potential solutions.
