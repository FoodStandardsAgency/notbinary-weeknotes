# D1:S2 (22/07/19 - 26/07/19)

**Tl;dr**: Awesome progress from the team | Top-notch engagement and collaboration with the users | Show & tell technical teething issues (but good content) | Unbearable heat (#AllTheShorts) | Show & tell: [Slides](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/irs-discovery-show-&-tell-2.pdf) & [Video](https://vimeo.com/350281671).

## This week
Another intense week for the team as we continue to speak to users, absorb information and make our way along the discovery of the [double diamond](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond). Lloyd joined the team this week to help out with some of the technical analysis; bringing in his immense experience in case management platforms (which is a big part of the core tech supporting the service). We're really pleased to have his support and he's already settled into the team nicely.

The major deliverable this week was getting the initial service blueprint drafted. We held a great collaborative session on Tuesday with representatives from across the service (resilience, incidents, engagement, receipting, data etc.). In just a few hours, we managed to define the service offering, customer, service users, service components, key activities, inputs, outputs and systems for the end-to-end service. This is all being continuously iterated on our [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kxZX6ow=/) but we'll be putting snapshots of it [here](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/service-experience-blueprint). This will be the baseline at the core of the discovery that we can layer loads of views over as we progress (E.g. volumes, pain points, opportunities, cost, unmet needs etc.).

We've also started to get a good understanding of the technology & data landscape. The team have produced an initial view of the [data flow](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/data-flow) flow of the service and an overview of it's [technologies](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/technology-overview). Plus we've done a ton more user research and analysis in-between; allowing us to start capturing early insights of pain points and opportunities.

We held our first physical & remote **show & tell** this week using [GoPro Hero7 Black](https://gopro.com/en/gb/shop/cameras/hero7-black/CHDHX-701-master.html) camera, [Blue Snowball](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/snowball-ice/) microphone, [Cam Link](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link-4k) video converter and [Bluejeans Events](https://www.bluejeans.com/events) conferencing software. Unfortunately, it wasn't exactly a roaring success. We were tethering over a [MiFi](https://shop.ee.co.uk/dongles/pay-monthly-mobile-broadband/4gee-wifi-mini-2018/details) (there is no guest Wi-Fi in Clive House) so we had a lot of bandwidth issues, the camera stopped halfway through, we couldn't switch between the slides and speaker etc etc. But we shouldn't let this dampen our spirits as the content presented was excellent and well received. We've had a good retro on it. Lots to learn and we'll iterate the set-up for next week.

## Next week
Quite a busy week shaping up for the team already. We'll be focusing on:
- Legislation and policy deep dive
- Building up the service map, capturing wider context
- Looking at volumes and metrics
- More user and stakeholder interviews
- On-going needs analysis
- Evolving pain points and opportunities
- Deep dive into Memex
- Review and iterate the technology & data overview

Quite a bit to get through but this is typically the last week of listening before we started formulating a view of the service to play back key themes for challenge and iteration. So expect to see more on that in next week's note.

The team are all hoping for a slightly cooler week next week after the heat wave _forced_ half the team to wear shorts on Thursday. We had a nice surprise of ice creams handed out by the CEO in the afternoon; a nicely timed treat as the show & tell wrapped up and London (nearly) hit it's high of 38 degrees centigrade.
