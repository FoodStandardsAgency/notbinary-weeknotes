# This week
We shared our progress so far with Sally, who suggested we step back a little from the specific problems and solutions to consider a higher level assessment of the service. We've gone onto do this, reflecting on the service's overall performance. 

The digital team supported us by tracking the 'Failed to send' issues over the week, with the reasons they could not be automatically forwarded to the relevant Local Authority. We now understand that the 'Failed to send' issues take up around 0.5h daily for the digital team. This is a fairly low cost to the FSA. However, it's worth considering that the manual step creates a delay in reports reaching their intended LA and therefore there may be some increased risk to the public.

We spoke to Richard at another Panoply company, Deeson, who manage the FSA website. He confirmed some of our understanding of how the system works and we discussed how else he might support us on the discovery. 

# Next week
We'll start our final week of this discovery checking in with Sally about our findings and draft recommendations. We're speaking to Local Authority relationship managers later in the week to validate our assumptions about LA pain points with them. We intend to share our write-up of the discovery by the end of the week in an open wiki.
