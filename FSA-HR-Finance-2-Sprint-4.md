# This week

This week we’ve continued to deepen our understanding of the key HR & Finance processes via follow up workshops where we have overlaid current pain points as well as volumes and metrics to the journey maps that we started creating with you all a couple of weeks ago. We’ve also made a big step forward in evolving the user personas and have also started writing up User Stories. The User Stories represent one of the deliverables for the HR & Finance Discovery and as mentioned at the Show & Tell we have approximately 120 drafted so far. As one of our deliverables for this Discovery, once completed these will be left with the FSA to act as a backlog of items for consideration should any prototyping, RPA or other work be undertaken in the future.

We had our first ethnographic research - otherwise known as an observation session - with Payroll and have planned more for next week with HR and Finance. We have also planned the RPA workshop which we’re very much looking forward to as it represents a key next stage in the Discovery process.

For those of you who aren’t aware Kirsty is moving on to pastures new so it was Kirsty’s last time at Foss House this week, although she will be working remotely next week to help us complete elements of our analysis. Thanks for your hard work and contribution during the last three weeks and best of luck in your new endeavours, Kirsty!

# Next week

We’ll continue writing of user stories which will will likely be added to given the observation and RPA sessions scheduled for next week. The collective task for the team of reviewing and refining the User Stories will continue in line with next weeks activities.

The RPA workshop is scheduled for Thursday which is a collective session with both HR and Finance. It was felt this was the best approach given that so many processes span the two Directorates We also have placeholders earmarked over Tuesday and Thursday to conduct our ethnographic research. In between that will be our usual Show and Tell spot on Wednesday at 1pm. We apologise for the slight delay in getting the show and tell started this week and have made sure we have Skype enabled rooms for the next two weeks so that we get off to a quick and smooth start as we did the previous - a big thanks to Liz for arranging this!

In light of Kirsty moving on, Sean Tubbs will be working with the team to support us in the final two weeks of the Discovery to assist with analysis and the write up of our final report which is due in a couple of weeks.
