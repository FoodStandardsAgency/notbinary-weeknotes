# D10:S2 (09/03/20 - 13/03/20)

## This week

This week has predominantly been about getting ready to start our user research. 

First off, we created a detailed research plan to establish who we are wanting to speak with; the areas we want to explore with each group; and, broadly how we are going to conduct the research. 

We have agreed that the 'in scope' groups for the research are:

* Local authorities representatives
* Food Business Operators
* Trade Associations
* FSA representatives 

Alison joined the team and set to work creating the interview guidelines for the research. These are essentially a form of 'script' that the interviewers will use to introduce themselves to the interviewee and then frame each conversation through a series of questions and/or prompts. They help us ensure we are both thorough and consistent in our approach, whilst also minimising any bias. 

Now we have agreed the research plan with FSA colleagues, including the Product Owner, we are now able to start setting up actual interviews, which we started doing towards the end of the week. 

## Next week

First up for interview will be local authorities. We have arranged x3 60 minute sessions for up to 15 (in total) to participate next week. These will be remote sessions led by members of the Discovery team that will seek to understand current LA experiences relating to:

* Engagement with FBOs in their area re. the SFBB pack
* The impact of SFBB on regulatory compliance:
* Technology needs   

In addition to these sessions, we need to set up interviews with FBOs to conduct over the coming weeks. We have reached out to x4 local authorities to help introduce us to FBOs in their area that we can then hopefully interview. Responses so far have been promising so we'll give you a full update next week.
