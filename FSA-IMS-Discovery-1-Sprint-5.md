# D1:S5 (12/08/19 - 16/08/19)

**Tl;dr**: 37 users met | Epic level user needs summarised | Service blueprint enriched and validated | Legislation & policy overview captured | The team are on the final stretch! | Show & tell: [Slides](/irs-discovery-show-&-tell-5.pdf) & [Video](https://vimeo.com/354048683).

## This week
The penultimate week has snuck up on us and the team have been flat out getting the researched finalised so we can start to focus on the write-up and making recommendations for moving forward.

We're up to **37 users met** with loads of service user and external provider interviews this week. It's been a massive push from Abi (well done!) and thanks again to all those who've helped her get sessions lined up. There's also been a ton of analysis and consolidation going on in the background to get the personas, user journeys and needs fleshed out so we can all start to see the final outputs.

Early indication is that there are seven key needs:
- Central system for incident management that facilitates tracking of different modes of communication, the status of an incident and who the incident is assigned to. 
- Ability to quickly search incident data for relevant information
- Ability to quickly report on metrics
- Consistent methods for sharing information
- Effective and consistent collaboration 
- Transparency around decision making
- Joint understanding of capacity

We've spent a significant amount of time iterating the service blueprint this week. Spending lots of time with some of the key users across the service to validate and update as we go. It's at a much more finite level of detail and we'll be continuing to add to this over the next couple days before loading a new version onto the wiki.

We've also looked into [Clue](https://clue.co.uk/) and [CLIO](http://www.badger.co.uk/products/clio-manager) to start to get a feel for their fit for the needs and whether to explore them in the Alpha phase. We did a deep dive into the legislation & policy and even managed to migrate to this awesome new wiki site :)

And finally, **Kudos** goes out this week to Stephen for actively seeking feedback on the Discovery process during the show & tell, Sean for completing the wiki migration, and Raj & Matt for helping review and iterate the service blueprint.

## Next week
It's the final week so the team are going to be in full-on write up mode. We'll be focusing on:

- Completing the user research artefacts   
- Creating a full service view of the pain points & opportunities
- Completing all the other discovery artefacts
- Write-up of the discovery options and final report  
- Planning for the next Alpha phase 

There's a bit of a common thread that **hinders** most of the needs of the serivce: the existing technology can’t flex; and data can’t flow through the service. We'll be exploring this further as we move into the recommendations next week.

Just as a reminder, we're not having the show & tell next week as we're pushing the final playback session to **Thursday 29th August @ 2pm** - we hope to see you there!
