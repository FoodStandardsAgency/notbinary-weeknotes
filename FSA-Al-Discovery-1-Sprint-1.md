## This week

The first week has been the usual blur of meet & greets and information overload. But it's fair to say that everyone has been extremely forthcoming and enthusiastic about the discovery. The existing project team have been very accommodating in lining up initial user research sessions for us. They even managed to arrange security passes for the team on day 1 (which isn't often the case and really helps get the team off to a flying start).

We've managed to meet most of the key internal users:

Service & Product Owner
Heads of Incident Management Team (and some their team)
Representatives from across the SHERAM team
Some Memex users
Local Authority engagement team
Heads of the Norther Ireland and Welsh agencies
This has allowed us to gleam a lot of early insights into pain points and opportunities across the service. For example:

There are a lot of barriers to data flow across the service (locked down systems, offline working on spreadsheets etc.).
Internal users have many frustrations with the core case management system (searching for information is tricky, you cannot easily see a chronology of a case or involvements).
There is a strong desire to deliver a more joined-up/collaborative service across the teams and external users of the service and data.
The forthcoming EU exit is driving a lot of work within the agency and must be factored into plans to ensure the service continues to deliver the mission of 'Food we can trust'.

## Next week
Next week will be focused on taking what we've learnt from week 1, synthesising and consolidating so we can start playing them back to users ASAP. Now we've met many of the key internal people, and we have some segments forming for externals, we will create a user engagement plan for the coming sprints to line up the relevant detailed research sessions.

We've planned a technology & data mapping session on Tuesday afternoon that will pull together a number of users from across the service to help us get our heads round all the data flowing through the relevant systems. We'll also be drafting the first pass of the service journey that we'll overlay with the user segments; further cementing our understanding of the service.

Essentially, by the end of Sprint 2, we hope to have: a full overview of the service and it's process defined; all user segments defined and a plan on how we're going to engage them; an overview of all the systems being used (internal & external) and the data that is being used. It's quite a tall ask for our second week but I'm sure the team are up for the challenge :)
