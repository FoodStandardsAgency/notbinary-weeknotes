## This sprint (30 Mar - 3 Apr)

A key goal this week has been to examine the FCI and CCIR process, as described in formal guidance. This complements the user segment mapping we carried out in the previous sprint, and has helped us to identify: 

- key expected activities 
- typical sequence of activities
- which organisations and actors are involved at each stage
- core information flow

Building up the picture of what should be happening, when and by whom helps identify potential gaps, complexities or issues that we can look out for in when we carry out user interviews or examine system designs. 

We have focussed on building this picture up for poultry and beef so far. There is a common series of stages and steps that we can begin to map out as a base process framework. We’ll go on to verify that against the processes for other species, such as pigs. 

This approach should yield a core group of tasks that we can extend with variations as needed, and which will help inform the data lifecycle and backlog for a potential minimum viable product. 

As well as building up our knowledge of the process and potential service lifecycle, we’ve been working with the Product Owner to line up user interviews as well as to develop the research scripts needed to validate our background research with actual experiences. The pandemic has impacted on availability, and meant we have also had to revise our approach. We originally intended to interview vets (who have specific accountabilities for FCI and CCIR data), but our focus next week will turn to meat inspectors. 

## Next sprint (6-9 Apr)

Easter holidays cut into the next two weeks, which is going to compress our time and capacity, as we switch from background research to more primary research.  

We have four interviews with Meat Hygiene Inspectors from Monday to Wednesday.  Supplementing these are sessions to go through the techniques and tools used for CCIR collection, as well as a further dive into IRIS and the supporting technology infrastructure.  There’s also a session with another FSA partner looking at the data standards related to FCI and CCIR. 

The current COVID situation has thrown some uncertainty around access to key user segments and industry stakeholders that will affect our research plans beyond next sprint. It’s quite a dynamic situation but we’ll be looking at resolving or mitigating that next week.

Finally, our first Q&A Text Chat is on Microsoft Teams on Monday 12:30pm-1pm.  There’s no Show & Tell next sprint (Good Friday), so normal service resumes the following sprint (Fri 17 Apr).
