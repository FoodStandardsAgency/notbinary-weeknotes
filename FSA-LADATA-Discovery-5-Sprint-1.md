# This week
The Notbinary delivery team – Layo, Lucy & Paul – kicked off our pre-Discovery work with Osman Tariq (Digital) and Mark Davis (Regulatory Compliance Division) on Tuesday in Clive House. 

We worked from Mark’s in-progress specification to write a long list of questions we want to answer within this discovery. These can be summarised in:
- What is the FSA need for further food safety data, and what would the benefits be? 
- Is it legally and technically possible to obtain further food safety data? What would the practicalities be?
- Is the food safety data likely to answer the FSA’s needs/questions in its current form?
- If there is a need for additional food safety data, and the FSA can’t access it via Local Authorities’ Management Information Systems (MIS), what other ways might be available?

Working from the detailed questions sitting under these, we’ve worked out what sessions we need to have with subject matter experts and what reading we need to start with. These sessions will be scheduled over the next week or so. We’ve also:
- Put together a list of Local Authority contacts who might be willing to participate in user research and identified which criteria we want to meet (variety of regions, MIS provider, performance and LA type)
- Reviewed previous work completed for Unified View and other data sharing investigations by the FSA and Epimorphics
- Drafted user research consent forms and email templates, and started on the discussion guides

# Next week

Next week we’ll be joined by our technical architect, completing our squad for the discovery. We will have two main focuses for the week:
1. Scheduling and preparing for user research with LAs
2. Understanding the legislation and policy around data sharing

Alongside this we’ll be doing a lot of desk research so that we can hit the ground running on week three with conversations with legislation, policy and data subject matter experts, as well as members of the Regulatory Compliance Division team. 

We won’t be starting Show & Tells ‘til week three, when they’ll start on **Tuesday 22nd October 11-12** on https://whereby.com/fsa-la-data.
