# P1:S5 (12/10/19 - 18/10/19)

**Tl;dr**: Completing second round of testing | Preparing for the third round | Sub Working Group mid-point playback | Evaluating FSA tools | Iterating the target solution 

## This week 
We have now entered the second half of the Prototyping stage (week 5 of 8) and there is an increased intensity about the work as we are now both still knee deep in testing as well as turning our minds to the final report. 

We concluded the second round of testing this week. Thank you to everyone who took part. Attendance was really good and we got some useful feedback and comments about how Clue, Dynamics and the 'target' service design compare. We looked at three specific types of functionality this round:

- Automatic audit trail for service providers to effectively evaluate an incident
- Ability to search incident data for relevant information
- Regular collaboration between all parties involved in an incident

We've also started a deeper dive into whether other digital tools currently used by the IRU could be used more effectively e.g. Teams, Skype, O365. This is a complimentary assessment that will support the wider FSA initiative to encourage staff to use digital tools available to them more effectively. 

Finally, we presented our 'mid point findings' to the Sub Working Group on Wednesday. This is a good opportunity to formally show all the prototyping work over the last four weeks, evolving findings and what we'll be doing over the remaining half of the work. Overall we got a 'thumbs up, keep going' response from the attendees. We shared some emerging thoughts based on findings to date - essentially there is no clear 'front runner' at this midpoint for either Clue, Dynamics, or indeed another option to support the future service. This is not unusual given we have another full round of testing to go in a couple of weeks time. 

## Next week 
Early doors we will be analysing the findings from the second round of testing and feeding back the learnings into the third round of testing. During this third and final round we will be exploring the remaining set of user needs from the prioritised backlog:

- Secure sharing of intelligence during a case
- Quick reporting on key metrics
- Automatic template population
- Data analytical capability
- Resource capacity and planning. 

As always, before we can build/configure the features for testing, we need to understand all the related business rules and business requirements. Getting these right is crucial as it underpins the integrity of any service design, specific to the IRU.  

We have started putting all our thoughts and findings on the [wiki](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/) (under 'Prototyping' section). 

See you at the Show and Tell every Tuesday at 1400.
