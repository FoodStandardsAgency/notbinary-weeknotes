# D4:S1 (09/09/19 - 13/09/19)
## This week
The Notbinary team – Layo (UR), Lucy (DM) and Onkar (service design) – arrived at Clive House on Monday and started with an overview of the service from our PO, Alison Saunders, before kicking off with the wider FSA RAFB (Register a food business) team. It was great to get a sense of the wider picture – there are other exciting projects taking place around food business registration and, more generally, the regulation of food businesses, that we need to be aware of as we explore the service.

This week the FSA team has been generous in sharing documentation of research work that has already taken place to inform our work, including:
* Detailed user personas and service blueprint created in the last couple of years
* Support model, service map and rollout plan of the new RAFB service on the FSA website (you can see the [new RAFB webform here](https://register.food.gov.uk/new/wrexham))
* Example local authorities using different user flows and the associated assets
* Analysis of the volume of registrations by business type and by Local Authority

We’ve drafted an ‘as is’ service blueprint outline – thanks to insight from Beverley Kuster, Mark Appleby, and Doug Carradice – that is shaping up nicely and making clear the more obvious pain points for users, including:
* GOV.UK PDF generation isn’t working for this journey, meaning the FBO cannot successfully complete the transaction through the digital route
* The journey for an FBO to find where to register their business is convoluted, and frequently FBOs are directed to the incorrect next step
* The content surrounding the journey is presented multiple times but not always in the clearest order or format

It also clarifies that the registration service is actually provided by local authorities, with support from GDS and FSA in the shape of systems and guidelines.

We’ve also had positive discussions about the boundaries of our scope – given it’s a 4-week discovery, we’re all keen to make sure we deliver the must-haves. You can view the [result of those discussions here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfskXYBrQ_R29SU8Yl0T1mXY-BApGjl35IKdV0cQC1Q/edit?usp=sharing). Many thanks go to our PO, Alison, who will be away for the next two weeks and rejoining us for the final week of the discovery. Also thanks to Stephen Blackmore, for feeding learnings from the Incidents discovery into our work. 

## Next week
We will be joined by Paul Murray, our business analyst, and we’ll also be changing PO – welcome!

The team will be diving into the technical landscape of the service, across the GOV.UK, FSA and LA sites. We have the support of our GDS contact, Steve Messer, and Paul Turner from the FSA digital team to provide context and resolve some unanswered questions about the current incarnation of the service. Technical architect Mark Appleby will be validating the systems swimlane of the service blueprint.

Meanwhile, Layo will be pulling out findings from the secondary user research available and validating those, where possible, with some light touch user interviewing. Thanks in advance to the relationship management team for their support in organising this.

We’ll have our first Show & Tell on Wednesday from 12 to 1pm at Clive House, Collaboration Zone 7-2 and would like to see as many as possible there, or joining us remotely on [https://whereby.com/fsa-rafb](https://whereby.com/fsa-rafb). We’ll also record the session for those who can’t attend. By this point we intend to have a complete draft of the service blueprint with user pain points and underlying technology and data flow.
