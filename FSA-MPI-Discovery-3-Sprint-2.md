## This week (27-30 Aug)
It's has been an intense and rich week in the discovery cycle. We've been
* consolidating our understanding of how the different parts of the service hang together. 
* starting to verify some of the emerging pain points and opportunities. 
* building up a picture of the legal and policy constraints, and how they might practically affect the scope of change that can be carried out in a timely way.
* discovering more about previous initiatives to improve timesheeting.
* understanding how and why the data captured is used operationally.

Our first site visit was an eye opener for getting a sense of how plants function, the conditions that field staff work in and how operational pressures might affect the timesheeting service. Interviews with inspectors, team leaders and contract vets are beginning to clarify different user motivations and pain points. Observing staff actually filling in or approving timesheets is helping to confirm where and how the system design is getting in the way of accurate and timely data capture. 

As we dive deeper into the data angle, a story is forming about the timesheeting system, Statements of Resource, staffing rotas, charging and daybooks, all hanging together by a theme of reconciling. There's more plot to unravel, particularly with intricate legal and policy twists. As the story unfolds, practical options for the next stage are becoming clearer. 

At the midway point of discovery, the user and data interfaces look like important target areas for improving the timesheeting system. Better data flows could certainly help improve the feedback the system gives to users while they are carrying out entry and approval tasks, as well as for realtime operational reporting. 

**Kudos** to Paul Hurst for setting up a really useful site visit; Richard Grossman for his extensive team leader insights; and Terina Hurley for the mobile walkthrough, background briefings and depth of service knowledge.  They've all been especially generous with their time and expertise.

## Next week (2-6 Sep)
We've got a second wave of **site visits** (Wed 4 Sep) lined up to supplement the previous week's field research. We want to do some further validation on the pain points and opportunities that have surfaced so far, especially in different plant environments. 

The **service mapping workshop** (Tue 3 Sep, 3pm-5pm, CR11, Foss House) will be a key point to bring stakeholders together across the entire timekeeping service. This is an important session to test how the pieces fit together, and what the impact of making changes in some parts may be on the others. 

Other activity we're planning to take us into the final discovery week include
- Elaborate user personas (including needs and motivations)
- Build up service map and user journeys
- Begin aligning user journeys, service map with data/system touchpoints
- Start framing practical options for alpha
- Begin interaction design analysis

We are also welcoming Sophie Ottoway to the team. She is an Interaction Designer who is going to help us define the system design opportunities.
