# D7:S5 (13/01/20 - 17/01/20)

## This week

We have again spent a large part of the week with our heads down, working through the back end of the analysis to inform our Phase One report. 

The report is now complete and we will be presenting it to the Business Sponsors on Monday in Cardiff. We'll share some of the findings and ideas from that in the next week note (after we have presented it).

We've created personas based on our research to date. There are five main types of user personas of people living with allergies to consider as part of a potential reporting solution:

* The non-believer
* The avoidant
* The extremist
* The proactive
* The opportunist sub persona

The first four personas are likely to be people who have had their food allergy medically diagnosed. These represented the vast majority of respondents to our recent online survey.  

The ‘opportunist sub persona’ is more likely to be some who is 'self diagnosed' and/or has a food intolerance as oppose to a serious allergy. This type of user is by their very nature quite difficult to reach. So particular consideration may need to be given about how to engage with these users as part of this work.

We've also started preparing for our service assessment this week, which is booked for next Wednesday 22nd January. If you are not familiar with them, these service assessments are a key part of the assurance process for developing new (digital) services. They help the FSA ensure that any new service incorporates the Government service standard https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard.

We'll let you know how it goes next week. Fingers crossed!

## Next week

We'll formally be taking a short pause between Phase One and Phase Two next week. However, we won't be idle. Key activities for next week include:

* Formal presentation of Phase One findings and emerging ideas to the Business Sponsors (Monday)
* Service assessment (Wednesday)
* Extended Show and Tell to the wider stakeholder community (Friday). This will be a highlighted version of the report from Monday

Crucially, we will also be planning for Phase 2 of the Discovery, which formally kicks off on Monday 27th January. This is expected to run for five weeks.
