# D8:S2 (10/02/20 - 14/02/20)

## This week 

This week was a week of research and gathering insights. 

We caught up with Darryl from UK Hospitality who provided some great insight from a wider UK Hospitality perspective, Darryl is the Chair of food experts group (includes companies like Nandos), as well as the Chairman of the FHR steering group. 

- Darryl also introduced us a few businesses that we could talk to for more insight: 
- Duncan from The Restaurant Group, which includes Wagamama, Chiquitos, Garfunkels and several more
- Claire from the Casual Dining Group (Cafe Rouge, Las Iguanas, Belgo, Huxleys, Oriel, Bella Italia)
- Tracey from Punch Pubs (group of 1300 pubs)

We also got the chance to talk to Ellen from ZERO2FIVE, a Food Industry Centre Food & Drink Research Unit based at Cardiff University. 

Our final insight session for the week was with Beverly from the Register a Food Business (RAFB) team at the FSA. It was good to get her perspective on the potential links between the FHRS and RAFB, as well as the challenges faced around data. 

Ema started work on a series of accessible badge designs, and started to explore how this would work on multiple devices, and how we would incorporate Welsh into the designs. 

## Next week 

Next week will be more insight sessions, with us catching up with Duncan, Claire and Tracey.

We will also start work on any technology and data considerations.
