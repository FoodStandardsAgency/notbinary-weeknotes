# P1:S5 (21/10/19 - 25/10/19)

**Tl;dr**: Reviewing research | Sharing high level findings | Revisions to the Clud UI target design | Testing models | Preparing for final round of testing

## This week
The team spent the week reviewing research videos and sharing the high level findings with the internal FSA team as well as the wider show & tell audience. As usual there was a high level of attendance and there were some very good questions raised.

We revised the Clue UI based on the target design and the existing Memex fields. Data from the four test incidents was input into the system and some data capture functionality was revised. We modelled and tested how the different data sets could be captured.

## Next week
We have booked participants for the final round of testing and are in the process of outlining the test guides for the exploratory and focused sessions planned for next week.

* Tuesday: focused session - 4 participants selected and contacted
* Wednesday: focused session - 4 participants selected and contacted
* Thursday: demo session and intro to exploratory testing

See you at the Show and Tell next Tuesday at 1400
