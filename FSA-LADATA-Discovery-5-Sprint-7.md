# This week

Since our last Show & Tell, we have spoken to:
* **Helen Castledine-Smith** (Official Feed and Food Controls), focusing on the challenges and opportunities in performance management
* **Darren Holland** (Operational Research), discovering how he and his team analyse data to inform decisions and actions 
* **John Cragg** (Food Hygiene and Feed Team), **Sue Harvey** (Feed Official Controls), and **Adam Rosser** (Feed Official Controls) understanding the process and use of feed returns
* **James Blackburn** (Food Hygiene Rating Scheme), learning about how data is used for the FHR scheme and the current pain points
* **Nathan Philippo** (Food Standards and Segmentation), to learn about how his team has been using data in defining the nature of official controls 

We've been folding these learnings into our written report, which has been the core activity of this week. Our written report details: what we've done, what we've learnt, and what we recommend. We've detailed our user research findings and also added supporting evidence from earlier Epimorphics research. 

We finished the week with our **fourth Show & Tell**. In this we shared our responses to the questions we set at the start of the discovery:
* What are the **needs** for and the **benefits** of obtaining this data? (for FSA, LAs, consumers)
* What are the **legal** mechanisms by which the FSA can obtain this data?
* What are the **practical** barriers to using this data?
* What is the **LA position** on the FSA accessing this data?
* What are the **technical** constraints to obtaining this data and how might they be overcome?
* What is the best course forward for the FSA?

In the summary of our findings, we outlined that we've observed some barriers that should be tackled as a prerequisite to any investment in improving access to Local Authority food and feed business data. 
1. Ambiguity of legislation
1. Cost of the technical build
1. Specificity of what data is needed and why
1. Quality of the LA data available
1. LAs are overstretched and reluctant to offer more
1. FSA resource to handle data
1. Measuring success of RCD activity

We went on to explore some recommendations for how to tackle these barriers. You can see the [slides from our presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hYvya3lBh43PeMIrya8Vkhli2zSgx3pHjOaQNW2nMTw/edit?usp=sharing) and the [video recording here](https://vimeo.com/374926464). 

# Next week
Next week the team will be moving onto new projects (some at FSA, some elsewhere), alongside which we will be finishing the write-up for this project. The report will be shared around by Os Tariq Mark Davis. 

We have a final playback scheduled for **11.30am -1.30pm 3rd December 2019 in Clive House**. In this session, we can discuss the findings in more detail and talk about how the team wants to progress.
