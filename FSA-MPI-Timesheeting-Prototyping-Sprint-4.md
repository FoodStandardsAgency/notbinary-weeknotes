Since the last weeknote, we've been wrapping up the Timesheeting Discovery, gathering final feedback before going through service assessment and handover. 

The prototyping phase has mostly been focused on iterating designs with primary users who directly enter and check inspection activity. However, we wanted to review the designs more widely with additional service users and owners. This included carrying out walkthroughs of the prototype journeys with Finance, Field Ops management and Reporting who have slightly different needs. 

Feedback was encouraging and helped confirm what we wanted to test through this stage of discovery: that we could simplify the user experience without losing data, and so could continue to meet the business outcomes required of Timesheeting. 

The prototyping phase was necessarily focused on prioritised use cases. But timesheet entry and review are only parts of the overall inspection management service. Zooming back out and checking in with other stakeholders has been critical to make sure we're still thinking and designing appropriately for the whole service. 

It's also one of the reasons we invite wider participation in the Show and Tells and Discovery retrospectives. From the initial kickoff workshop and right through to that last Show & Tell, we've seen how getting people in different roles and departments into the same space helps give richer texture to what we uncover and play back. These regular 'ceremonies' become a forum for discovering common ground, understanding different perspectives and surfacing implicit assumptions. With those in the open, it's much easier to build trust, identify opportunities and do good things together.

The collaboration and shared commitment that has built across stakeholders around Timesheeting came through strongly in the full retrospective that followed the final show and tell. 

This alignment and momentum was also evident in the **service assessment**, an independent review of the work that's been done and the outputs produced during the project. It was an opportunity for the FSA to ask: "are we doing the right thing, in the right way, at the right time?" 

The enquiry probed outputs and methods along the lines of user need, service design, business analysis, technology and the team's ways of working. It sought to assure that we have been focusing on the right things in Discovery that would enable allow the FSA to make decisions about whether and how to proceed. The outcome of the assessment was successful and you can read the [full review and recommendations here](https://fsa-timesheeting.herokuapp.com/en/service-assessment).

## What happens next

The Notbinary team has largely finished with Timesheeting, with the exception of sketching up some options for a question-based timesheet entry model.

FSA Digital are picking up where we leave off to determine how to take this forward to the next stage of service development, including considering the service assessment recommendations. 

We've done a handover and walkthrough of the discovery process outputs with them, particularly the prototyping, user stories and scorecard that evolved from the user research and business analysis. We'll continue to support the knowledge transfer needed to transition to the next stage of service development, including on the architecture approach that could support strategic technology transformation.

A key takeaway for this discovery is that **Timesheeting serves Inspections** and that it's not the only service component in play. We've also seen and learnt a lot on this project, not just about meat plant inspections, but also how to make this type of enquiry work well in the FSA. The support Notbinary has received - particularly from FSA Digital, Field Ops and Finance - has been brilliant, and we couldn't have succeeded without it and the trust we've quickly built as a partnership. 

To keep up the momentum and follow through on our findings and recommendations, we're delighted that the core Notbinary + FSA delivery team will continue working together for our next assignment.  That is to move straight into taking a deeper look at Statements of Resource and rotas, two inspection resourcing 'systems' that are used to support provision and delivery of inspection controls.
