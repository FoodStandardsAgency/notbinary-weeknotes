## This Week (25-29 Nov)

We've turned our attention over the latest sprint to wrapping up the service and user mapping and analysis review for rotas in order to leave the remaining schedule clear for prototyping and feedback, as well as write-up for the research and analysis to date. 

To that end, it's been invaluable to get further input from the service delivery partner on how the inspections resourcing service affects them. They've been generous with their time and contribution, and it's given some excellent insights into some of the cultural constraints and operational challenges. 

A recurring theme is the time pressure to respond (or more realistically, react) to late changes. There's very little early warning of known or planned events that would affect workforce allocations, and it does materialise it creates pressures on delivery and the people involved. 

Re-designing Field Ops rota management as a service in collaboration with delivery partners could help

* Improve visibility of resourcing factors (such as planned absences, training days, retirement churn, etc) across the supply chain
* Reduce handoffs (which can perpetuate delays and miscommunication)
* Improve adherence to agreed service levels

Back on the Statement of Resources front, we've taken a hard look at the structure and purpose of the SOR. Following the user research and analysis, our starting point for prototyping has been to revisit the overall flow of data capture.  

That has thrown up questions about what data is *actually* needed to be captured when building up an SOR. It's apparent it's a single 'system' but that the output serves multiple purposes, some of which are incidental to the core purpose of setting and communicating expectations of resource provision. How far a clearer flow, prioritised towards that goal, can help improve the quality of SORs is something we hope to learn from prototyping feedback in the next fortnight. 

Alongside that, this week we've also been looking at how the SOR accuracy reports measure up. There's scope for having more granularity and narrative context in them to illustrate the dynamic and nature of variance, rather than headline expected vs actual hours. 

Something like that could yield more actionable management information, and help unburden the Inspection Team Leaders from some of the more time-consuming manual followup and investigation, so they have more capacity to focus on [delivering core service operations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mPcBr3xhsrR0ycSTyuSn3mo_3Uw7AEck7vyBol09FeE/edit#slide=id.g6b75e5faba_0_150) and managing team, customer and supply chain relationships. 

## Next Week (2-6 Dec)

There is a plant site visit on Wednesday to give our user researcher direct experience of the environmental and operational context of meat plant inspections. We found this enormously valuable during the Timesheeting discovery, and it should help inform and give further texture to our write-ups and recommendations this SOR and rota discovery. 

Apart from that, stakeholder interviews and desktop research are largely done. There are some gaps to plug as we focus on documenting our analysis and findings, including elaborating personas, user journeys and service blueprint. 

However, that's not the end of discovery: we're diving head first into testing prototype designs, with sessions on Tuesday and Thursday to get feedback on possible revised flow and data capture process for capturing statements of resource.  This will be iterated and incremented over the coming fortnight to encapsulate the wider prototyping scope we identified [last week]( FSA-MPI-Resourcing-Discovery-6-Sprint-3).
