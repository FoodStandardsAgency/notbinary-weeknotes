# This week
This is the penultimate week of the HR and Finance Discovery and its been another busy one! The team have been finishing up the service maps and user journey sessions by overlaying volumes and metrics for HR, Finance and IT. This allows us to determine the impact to the business of the challenges faced and will also help with the prioritising which areas might be worth looking at first.

Oliver ran a robotic process automation workshop which went very well. Using a specialised tool which allows us to take into account a multitude of different metrics - such as hours worked, task volumes, processing time and more - we are able to discern which processes will potentially make good candidates for RPA.

We have also conducted numerous ethnographic research sessions which has really brought everything to life and added more context to the discussions had during workshops. Thanks again to everyone who spent time with us.

In addition to working with the core Discovery team (Service Owners, Product Owners and Subject Matter Experts) we had some great sessions at Clive House to gain alignment with the FSA’s exec team to make sure the the options presented in our final Discovery report are aligned with the strategic vision of the organisation. This included looking at what options are realistic / feasible as well as understanding principles relating to users, technology and data.

# Next week
The main focus next week will be the writing of the final HR and Finance Discovery report, which will draw on all of the information gathered during the Discovery as well as our experience of working with other, similar organisations. We’ll also be looking at getting a playback session scheduled where we can share it with everyone.

We’ll be completing our RPA analysis which will obviously form part of the final recommendations in our Discovery report. We also have a few final observation sessions scheduled as well as a remote workshop on Monday to perform some analysis on Digital Workplace.
