## This week (11-15 Nov)

We've been focused on interviews with Team Leaders and Area Managers to understand what the Field Ops experience of rotas and Statements of Resource are, in the context of delivering inspection services. A picture of the daily resourcing challenges is emerging, not only for them, but also the impacts on adjacent roles. 

Anecdotally we've understood that there are probably as many ways to manage a rota as there are Team Leaders. Early findings suggest that the resourcing issues are broadly the same. However, one factor in this lack of consistency is variances in cluster profiles, which leads to different daily realities from one Team Leader to the next. 

That drives slightly different needs from essentially the same tool, which is then tailored to suit local conditions and ways of working. Individual local knowledge - eg, about staff, contractors, the businesses, local markets - also factor into how the resourcing tools might be used - and maintained - in order to support operational delivery. 

It's becoming clear to see also that current tools generally do work in simple cases, but they don't scale well - especially when there is complexity in a plant's operations. However, even without additional complexity, there are digital and manual steps that a manager needs to go through to set up both Statements of Resources and rotas. This creates extra friction in the whole process, with a knock-on to data accuracy, re-usability, visibility and timeliness. That especially begins to pinch when dealing with late or last-minute changes to rotas. 

Field Ops is rich with localised problem solving and innovation. There's strong self-reliance with homegrown tools to manage the immediate operational priorities. With that, however, is arguably a detachment from the FSA's wider service provision and processes. To that end, it's been useful this week to get some preliminary insight into the strategic goals around rota centralisation and forecasting. There is a gap to be bridged between the local (cluster and area) picture of inspection service resourcing and the national forecasting and planning picture. How these come together - and to what extent the overall picture can be sharpened through better local resourcing tools - is at the edge of our discovery scope, but certainly something to be mindful of as we proceed. 

Also this week we've been exploring some of the design patterns in play with commercial rota management products. As user needs emerge, we'll be able to apply this research to consider appropriate interaction models to prototype going forward. 

## Next week (18-22 Nov)

More interviews with Team Leaders and Area Managers are scheduled next week. Patterns and themes are emerging, but there's a lot of variance in individual experiences. Talking with a few more users will help give more texture and understanding into the nature of that variance and some of the different approaches and solutions being used in  the field. 

We'll also be following up with the Change Business Implementation Unit and the Finance teams, within the FSA, as well as the Service Delivery Partner. Wider stakeholder input will help build the fuller picture of the service context that the current resourcing tools support or hinder. 

There's already a lot of deep input we're gathering from primary and secondary users. We've mostly been in sponge mode thus far, but we need to take a pit stop next week to review and consolidate our learning. Once we've done some sense-making of it all, we'll be in a better position to start coherently identifying the critical gaps we need to fill in understanding the potential and limitations of the resourcing tools, and how they support the inspection service. That analysis and reflection will shape our priorities for discovery through prototyping, which we will start moving towards the following week.
