# D7:S2 (09/12/19 - 13/12/19)

## This week

The big story this week is that we have kicked off our interviews with users and external stakeholders. First up were three (of several) local authorities - two in the South East, one in the North West. We gleaned a huge amount of insights about what role these local authorities play in supporting members of their community who wish to report an allergic reaction to food. 

It's clear that each local authority we have spoken to are passionate about supporting consumers (users)
Not surprisingly, it appears that user journeys may vary depending on which local authority they report an allergy related matter e.g initial data capture will be different. Differences in how local authorities are structured is likely to play role in this. This is something we need to get to the bottom of. 

We also interviewed a clinician specialising in paediatric food related allergies, a food allergy sufferer who set up his own reporting tool in the US 10 years ago (and has had thousands of postings since then) and internal stakeholders within the FSA. We'll share some of the resulting insights once we start to see trends emerging. 

We have taken the outputs from the mapping sessions from Sprint 1 and have created a digital version of what some of the existing pathways are. These digital maps help us to ‘frame’ each stage of a possible journey or experience. One of the these maps illustrates the existing common data collection points into which consumers can report their allergic reactions, or potentially a 'near miss' experience throughout the UK. Interestingly, the FSA doesn't currently have access to much of this data. This poses a series of questions that the discovery team need to investigate further. 


## Next week

Main focus this week will be speaking to more users and stakeholders. The week before Xmas will be intense, but we've managed to secure a large number of interviews, which is impressive at this time of year. 

Crucially, we will be conducting our first user interviews this week i.e. people who suffer from food related allergies. We are keen to understand what their experiences are, including:
* Have they reported an allergic reaction in the past? 
* What motivated them to do so? 
* How did they report it? 
* Was there any follow up? 

Also, Rohela is visiting Barnsley where they have been conducting a pilot into reporting allergic reactions to food. 

We will be asking this via both some one on one interviews, plus an online survey that the team have put together over the last few days. 

We'll be analysing their responses as we go, although the full analysis won't happen until the new year once we've completed all the interviews. 

See you next week.
