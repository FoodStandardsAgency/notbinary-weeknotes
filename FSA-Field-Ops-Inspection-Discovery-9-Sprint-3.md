## This week (10-14 Feb)

We started a series of sprints dedicated to individual inspection domains this week, kicking off with Dairy. Our site visit was called off due to Storm Ciara, but we did carry out five depth user interviews remotely. This has given us valuable insight into the environmental and operational contexts within which users have to apply the official controls. 

The [guidance](https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/manual-for-official-controls) is clear in setting out the purpose, policy and process governing service delivery and expectations.  It also appears to fairly reflect some of the complexity of triggers, interactions and touchpoints that the existing service design and tooling begets. 

That said, it inevitably can't capture some of the day-to-day realities that inspectors have to contend with.  We've seen through the [Field Ops Resourcing discovery](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki) how important local knowledge is to get the job done. Inspections is similar, and part of this is underpinned by a service tension between executing planned and reactive work.  

When an inspection throws up a number of issues, there is a knock-on for other scheduled inspections that may need to get bumped in order to create the capacity to complete inspection admin, as well as undertake essential follow up visits.  

Coupled with a diaspora of local tooling (used in the gaps between inspections systems provisioned by the FSA), there are workload management pressure points at play. How far they can be alleviated remains to be seen. 

In parallel to the Dairy research, we've also had a useful briefing on how [Audits](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TIYlMVhG92YjLR5XRWRkKtmFX1TDfK2CMsIAarFQyXw/edit#slide=id.g7e01cb868b_0_0) works. This provides some helpful context for comparing with UAI and other inspection areas. It has surfaced potential commonalities with and - perhaps more importantly - differences from other service areas. A challenge is going to be finding the right level of 'lowest common denominator' to define a consistent service framework, while still honouring the nuances of specific inspection domains. 

As we progress, we're gathering evidence to validate some of our working assumptions. A key hypothesis is that there is a common lifecycle for inspections. There's more to test on this, but based on audit and dairy research so far, it feels increasingly true. A broadly consistent framework (even if the subject matter detail is different) is going to be fundamental to build on commonalities.

## Next week (17-21 Feb)

We're switching context from Dairy to Unannounced Inspections.  The UAI Leads gave us a good overview in the first week, and it's been helpful to see the state of progress on the K2 UAI development. Combined with the briefing on Audits, this puts us in a good place to dive into the detail with inspectors and field veterinary coordinators.
