# D7:S11 (24/02/20 - 28/02/20)

## This week

Entering the final week of the Discovery, the first couple of days were spent finalising our report, including the recommendations section. 

We then presented to the business sponsors on Thursday. This was a 2 hour session that allowed the sponsors to dive into some of the details that lead to the the team's recommendations. 

On Friday, we presented an edited version as part of our final show and tell to the wider stakeholder group. 

The team concluded the Discovery with **five** core recommendations:

**Recommendation One**

We recommend the creation of a new, FSA-owned, online reporting tool, which captures the end user data and shares the data with the relevant local authorities meets the end user needs, FSA needs and local authorities.

**Recommendation Two**

We recommend developing a new, FSA-owned, online reporting tool, which captures the end user data, shares this with the relevant local authority but the FSA maintain the overall responsibility for managing each case. This option will meet the end user needs, FSA needs and local authority needs.

**Recommendation Three**

The FSA should also seriously consider using clinical data to help inform policy relating to allergic reactions to food. Clinical data represents the most serious allergic reactions to food and therefore must be included if the FSA wants a complete data set for determining policy.  The FSA is unlikely to get data on serious reactions and fatalities without this data. This recommendation is essentially an endorsement for the direction of travel that the FSA is now undertaking via the anaphylaxis register.

**Recommendation Four**

The FSA should continue to engage with FBOs and encourage voluntary sharing of their incident data, where FBOs are happy to do so. This data could provide some additional, informal insights. We recognise the importance of maintaining a healthy dialogue with the industry. However, due to the concerns and challenges of generating consistent, unbiased quality data from FBOs, any data shared by FBOs should be treated anecdotally.

**Recommendation Five**

The FSA should also use surveys for augmenting data relating to allergic reactions to food.

Determining between recommendation 1 and 2 is dependent on the FSA deciding how much is wishes to get involved in the investigation part of any given incident once it has been reported (which would result in recommendation 2). This would also likely lead to better quality outcome related data. 

Recommendations 3-5 should be seen as **additions** to having a dedicated reporting tool and could provide supplementary data. 

Now the report and recommendations have been made, the FSA team now need to consider whether to proceed to an Alpha phase. 

In the meantime, we would like to formally thank all the contributors to the Discovery work over the last couple of months. We've learnt a great deal about the world of food allergies and have enjoyed working with you all.
