## This Week (18-22 Nov) 

Since the previous Show & Tell, we have been validating our findings with a broader community of stakeholders, including 

* *in the field:* Inspection Team Leaders and Area Managers
* *backoffice:* CBI, Finance and Contracts
* *external:* Service Delivery Partner

That's helped to consolidate our understanding of the scope and scale of the Inspections Resourcing challenge, and to think more clearly about what can realistically be done next as we [switch gears from research to prototyping](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13vvfBcdFu7FrnfQRG5izFq_Sf_-myWXqveAcLmW0Pwg/edit#slide=id.g6b75e5faba_0_627). 

As part of that process of narrowing options, we've taken time out to bring together our learnings and perspectives from different workstreams in the Discovery. That's painted a clearer picture of the primary stakeholder relationships, draft persona shape for Inspection Team Leaders, and the initial service and user journey mapping for Statements of Resource. 

With those outlined, it's been easier to identify key pain points and opportunities, and the [emergent themes]( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13vvfBcdFu7FrnfQRG5izFq_Sf_-myWXqveAcLmW0Pwg/edit#slide=id.g6b5bb178e0_0_308 ) that are currently hindering the service. As with timesheeting, there is a lot of manual effort, workarounds and reliance on off-system notes that are involved in SOR and rota management. 

Additionally, there is a lack of common or clear guidance on how to manage the resourcing service and related processes (including their triggers, inputs and outputs). That inconsistency has resulted in a disparate collection of tools and practice, which makes it difficult to treat as a service in its current form. 

So over the next 3 weeks of prototyping we'll focus on exploring new approaches and challenging that way things are currently done around the Statements of Resource. In particular, we want to examine options to: 

1. **Improve the user experience**
   1. SOR entry flow (layout and navigation)
   2. Usability improvements (data entry, system feedback)
   3. Automating options based on business rules (to take away some of the manual load)
   4. Completion: handoff, distribution and versioning
2. **Improve guidance**
   1. SOR review checklist 
   2. Contextual help

There is further work to do to finish off mapping out the rota service and journey and document our research on that front. But it's clear that focussing on some [pivotal SOR service components]( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13vvfBcdFu7FrnfQRG5izFq_Sf_-myWXqveAcLmW0Pwg/edit#slide=id.g6b5bb178e0_0_613 ) will help provide a better understanding and clearer path forward to drive timesheet and rota integration, while still heading towards the goal of accurate and reliable data to support the inspection service as a whole. 

## Next Week (25-29 Nov)

This sprint is the pivot to _discovery through prototyping_. There are some research loose ends to follow up and to wrap up, and further analysis and documentation of findings to date to write up. To that end, we'll be working on:

* Service and user journey mapping for rotas
* Service delivery partner interviews
* Document pain points & opportunities
* Draft personas, user journeys and service blueprint
* Map data and interaction flows
* Define prototyping scenarios and hypotheses
* Preliminary prototype sketches (SOR entry and flow)

Along with confirming the prototyping feedback itinerary, this will help get things lined up to show what's possible with SOR and to test how that plays out with users over the next 2-3 weeks.
