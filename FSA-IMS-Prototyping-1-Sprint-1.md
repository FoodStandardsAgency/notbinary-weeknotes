# P1:S1 (16/09/19 - 20/09/19)

**Tl;dr**: Onboarding prototyping team | Demos of Clue and MS Dynamics | Agreeing case scenarios | Extracting real life case data | Reviewing the backlog 

## This week 
So, after a successful Discovery, the Prototyping formally kicked off this week. 

The ultimate goal of the prototyping stage is to de-risk the product selection for the Incident and Resilience Unit to make sure the core digital solution that underpins the service will meet user needs. To do this, we will be doing a 'bake off' (Sean's words) between (**Clue**) and (**Microsoft Dynamics 365**).  Both solutions are considered credible contenders to meet the user needs and have a successful track record of supporting case management across multiple sectors. On the face of it, Clue could be described as more 'off the shelf', whilst Dynamics offers a much more configurable option. Both of these options will have pros and cons - the overarching question we'll testing throughout the prototyping is - how well do they meet the user needs (as captured in the Discovery). 

We only have 8 weeks to do this, so this week has been particularly intense. Key activities have included:
- on-boarding 4 new team members (business analyst, 2 developers and a UX designer). 
- a formal kick off with the sub-working group
- having demos for both MS Dynamics and Clue for the team
- confirmed 20+ IRU team members for getting involved in the user testing
- working through the prototyping backlog with the whole team
- getting Dynamics CRM provisioned 

Crucially. we have also agreed the following scenarios with the sub-working group that the team will be using to test against:

**Types**
1. Meat (this will include field ops)
2. Outbreak e.g. listeria
3. Micro e.g. salmonella in chicken
4. Allergy e.g. undeclared peanuts

**At least one of the responses must include:**
1. Food alert - allergy, PRIN
2. RASFF
 
Finally, a massive kudos to Rebecca (Product Owner), Jannika and Beth (Subject Matter Experts) for will be continuing with their Discovery roles into the prototyping as additional core delivery team members (Matt will be re-joining the team next week as Technical SME too after he is back from a week fishing). We've already been pretty demanding of their time, so thank you!

## Next week 
Priority for early next week will be to sign off the revised (more detailed) backlog with Rebecca and the team.
 
We'll then start sketching out design ideas for the developers to start building first iterations of a series of features on both Clue and Dynamics that can be tested against the scenarios outlined above. This will involve a great deal of work and team will be working rapidly to get these early ideas in place. 

Once we have these early prototypes in place, we'll start testing with real users to see what you like about them and how we can improve them. Thank you to everyone who has volunteered to get involved in the testing as part of the prototyping. We'll be in touch in the next week to tell you more about what this will involve. 

We'll be restarting our Show and Tells as of next week - every Tuesday next week at 1400 - everyone welcome!
