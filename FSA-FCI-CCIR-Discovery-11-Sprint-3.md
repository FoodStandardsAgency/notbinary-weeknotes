## This sprint (6-9 Apr)

A key focus of this sprint has been interviews with meat inspectors to better understand how condition data is actually collected within slaughterhouses, as opposed to what the guidance describes (which we have been immersing ourselves in over the previous fortnight). 

To supplement this we had an eye-opening session covering the digital, analogue and cognitive tools and techniques that are in play at different plants - a range including banks of clickers, laminated sheets, electronic terminals and more. 

It’s also been helpful to connect into the FSA’s data community (including partners, Epimorphics) to understand some of the efforts that have been made to develop standards and registers that can transform application development in this space. Developing a more open tech infrastructure can certainly enable better information flow (whether to producers or other systems, such as the Livestock Information Programme), which is a fundamental concern for the FCI/CCIR data lifecycle and the food safety mission. 

What’s apparent - and increasingly so from the primary research evidence - is that there are significant non-technical constraints that will impact the feasibility and deliverability of any such digital solution. We have more users to interview to help us better understand what could be achieved and the pain points that need to be (and can usefully be) addressed. 

To that end, further progress has been made with unlocking the next round of user interviews (with vets) and boiling down the key industry group targets.  

Working fully remotely on this discovery has meant we have had to change how we carry out some of our work. Our usual agile ceremonies are continuing to serve us well for planning and course correcting, as well as flagging potential issues. We’re starting to supplement them with short focused knowledge-sharing and synthesis sessions which helps keep us abreast of our discrete workstream insights and on the same page. We’re finding Miro is serving us well as a digital whiteboard for these collaborative workshops. 

## Next sprint (14-17 Apr)

When we return after the Easter break, our user research focus will be the veterinarians who have accountability for receiving and acting upon FCI and CCIR data within slaughterhouses. 

We’ve got a session to review the work done on a blockchain trial for the CCIR data collected in slaughterhouses. It will be useful to understand whether and how this fits in with the work the Data team have previously done. 

Alongside this, we should be in a position to start baselining FCI data collection, identifying what is common across species along with specific variations. 

We had a good round-up session pulling together the meat inspector interview learns this week, and we’ll be aiming to do the same for vet insights next week. It’ll be good then to share the emergent findings when Show and Tells resume on Friday.
