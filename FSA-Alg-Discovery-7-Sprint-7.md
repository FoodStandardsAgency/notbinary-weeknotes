# D7:S7 (27/01/20 - 31/01/20)

## Last week

Last week we formally kicked off Phase 2 of our Discovery. 

In Phase One, we were looking to answer:

* Is there a user need to report allergic reactions to food? (Yes)
* Do the current reporting solutions available meet that need? (No)

The key question for Phase 2 is 'How can an FSA reporting solution meet the user need whilst meeting the FSA's need for more information about people living with allergic reactions to food'?

You can see a one page overview of what the team will be doing over the next five weeks in the following attachment:

We started the week with the excellent news that the team had passed it's internal service assessment! We received a useful set of detailed observations and suggestions from the assessment panel about where the team had done well and recommendations for things they should consider for Phase 2. 

You can read the report in the link below:

Rohela led the team through a business requirements session. We gathered some of the business requirements in Phase 1. The purpose of this 'follow up' session (to the initial requirements gathering in Phase 1) was really to dig deeper and challenge some of the understanding and assumptions we started with seven weeks ago. The team's knowledge and thinking is becoming a lot more refined at this stage. So it was a good time to revisit some of the fundamental questions, including:

* What data/information does the FSA _actually_ need and what will the additional data allow it to do that it cannot currently?
* What impact would a reporting solution have on the FSA/local authority relationship? 
* What will be the impact of a new reporting solution on the existing Report A Food Problem service?

Outputs from the session really helps to provide a framework for the team to move through this second phase. 

Ensuring a new reporting solution is easy to find will be critical to encourage take up amongst the user community.  We've started to look into how existing FSA online services currently make themselves 'discoverable' via search engines (Google, Bing). We've also spoken to representatives from the National Careers Service and BEIS to understand what they have been doing in this space. More about this next week.. 


## Next week

We'll be continuing on a number of areas that we started on last week, including:

* establishing data rules
* exploring discoverability considerations
* thinking about service design principles

On Tuesday we have a meeting with the Industry Exchange Group - essentially a self-selected community of food business operators (FBOs) including Pret, Greggs, Nandos and Dominos. Partly a relationship building opportunity (particularly for any potential Alpha work), this is a good opportunity for the team to prober a bit deeper into the FBO-related findings from Phase One. 

Weekly Show and Tells re-commence in the weekly Wednesday time slot too. Hopefully see you there.
