**Tl;dr**: Completing first round of testing and analysing the results | Preparing for and conducting the second round | Capturing business rules | Iterating the target solution | Presenting to the Sub Working Group

## This week 
The team concluded the first round of testing successfully at the beginning of the week. In total, we had 4 actual face to face testing sessions, each one last approximately 90 minutes. We also had around a dozen more users attend the drop in session. The first round tested out Clue and Dynamics' ability to support the following user story:

'As a user of the service I must be able to see all the information about an incident that I am permitted to see in one place so that I can have an up-to-date view'.

This involved testing:

* View a notification
* Update the incident file and assign it an incident officer
* Add a file to an incident
* Add a task to the incident and assign the task to another user

We got some great feedback from the users - thank you to everyone who participated.  

In parallel to the Clue and Dynamics testing, we have also been sharing some of the target service design proposals. These have been very well received by people. The target service design represents the 'ideal state' for the service, essentially a baseline, to which the service should strive towards - although time and money constraints means that some of the target service design will not be attainable for the foreseeable future, so acceptable compromises will need to be found. Part of the prototyping will explore where these need to made and proposals for doing so. 

## Next week 
This week will be conducting our second round of testing. During this next round we will be exploring the next set of user needs from the prioritised backlog:

- Automatic audit trail for service providers to effectively evaluate an incident
- Ability to search incident data for relevant information
- Regular collaboration between all parties involved in an incident

We'll also be making changes based on the learnings from the first round testing and then testing these modifications as part of this second round to see what users think - this listening/making changes approach is a core element to how we work and is commonly referred to as 'iteration'. 

Before we can build/configure the features for testing, we need to understand all the related business rules and business requirements. Getting these right is crucial as it underpins the integrity of any service design, specific to the IRU.  This is a big part of our work for early this week. 

Finally, we are presenting our 'mid point findings' to the Sub Working Group this Wednesday. This is a good opportunity to formally show all the prototyping work over the last four weeks, evolving findings and what we'll be doing over the remaining half of the work. 

See you at the Show and Tell every Tuesday at 1400.
