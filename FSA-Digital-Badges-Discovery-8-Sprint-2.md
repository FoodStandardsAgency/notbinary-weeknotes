# D8:S2 (03/02/20 - 07/02/20)

## This week 

This week the team managed to catch up with several internal stakeholders at the FSA:

* Ema caught up with Una, Sioned and Jayne to under more about the FHRS brand and the previous designs. We learnt about some of the challenges faced during previous work, for example, accessibility rules meant they were restricted to using a white background with less information up-front.
* Zoe met with Bronagh to discuss work already underway with food delivery aggregators, such as Justeat, Ubereats and Deliveroo. 
* Paul caught up with Una to understand the Northern Ireland status, such as what is happening with the current draft legislation.

The discovery team also had their first show and tell, which went down well and clarified the purpose of this discovery. 

## Next week 

Next week we try to get in front of food businesses and aggregators. We will be meeting with: 

* UK Hospitality 
* NT Assure, a food safety consultancy 
* ZERO2FIVE, a Food Industry Centre Food & Drink Research Unit based at Cardiff University
