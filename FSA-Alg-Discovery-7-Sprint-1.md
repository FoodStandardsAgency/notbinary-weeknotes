# D7:S1 (02/12/19 - 06/12/19)

## This week

The team have had a great first week. The FSA team - Hannah, Ross and Elsa, have all been extremely helpful in ensuring the NotBinary crew can move quickly. By the end of the first week we have 18 stakeholder and user research interviews lined up – no mean feat in the run up to Xmas! I suspect there will be a few more to add to this over the coming days as well..

Rohela and Sue spent a couple of days in Cardiff with Hannah and co mapping out an early version of how the current landscape operates. This helps the team quickly understand who the main players are, what their roles are and some of the early ‘pain points’ to help inform all the upcoming interviews. 

We also had our first Show and Tell which was well attended - thank you to everyone who dialled in. Same time every week - Wednesday at 1300. 

## Next week

We have taken the outputs from the mapping sessions and are creating a digital version of what some of the existing pathways are. These digital maps help us to ‘frame’ each stage of a possible journey or experience. As we progress through the interviews these maps provide a reference point for us to explore a lot deeper to understand user needs and ultimately how they may be best/better met. 

The interviews start in earnest next week. We are starting with a number of Local Authorities and then will progress on to other potential user groups, include consumers themselves – people who suffer from allergic reactions to food. 

We'll let you know some of the early findings of these initial conversations at the next weeknote.
