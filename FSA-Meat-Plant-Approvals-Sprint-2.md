## This week (22-26 Jun)

We’ve had daily rounds of interviews in the latest sprint week, with internal users right across the Approvals team, as well as other stakeholders from Ops Transformation, Finance, Legal, Application Support and Veterinary Services. 

The user research has highlighted how manual the approvals process is throughout the workflow, from FBOs making and the FSA receiving applications, through to conducting and reporting on inspection visits, shepherding approval applications through different stages and finally actually granting, rejecting or withdrawing approved status.  

We’ve seen in our other discoveries with FSA Field Ops how manual processes can lead to avoidable errors, and where extra manual checks are put in place to mitigate the risk of the original manual processes, which typically just shifts the problem to another part or actor in the process. 

The administrative complexity is certainly increased by the technology and methods currently in place. It also seems to be exacerbated by access to and visibility of processing data, such as application status and deadlines. The transaction volumes for approvals is low, but a considerable amount of manual effort is spent on making this more transparent and reporting potential performance issues that could diminish timely service delivery. The technical opportunities for improvement are many, and will be rooted in better data collection and transfer. 

The stakeholder perspectives are helping to establish the operating and strategic contexts for premises approval. We’re building up a sense that there is a real interest, need and utility for the data that is potentially gathered during approvals for processes that happen adjacent and downstream of it. Improving segmentation and enhancing the risk-based approach to delivering official controls is a key strategic concern, along with better tracking and communication of application status to FBOs and internal stakeholders. 

A continued challenge for the project is access to food business operators. After a promising early response, engagement has dropped off a cliff edge. We’ve re-issued an reminder invitation to participate, and aim to accommodate any businesses that can get back to us by Wednesday.  I’m hopeful that more FBOs will take this opportunity to help inform our understanding of the process that sets off their (hopefully longstanding) relationship with their Competent Authority. 

## Next week (29  Jun - 3 Jul)

We’ll persist with securing access to FBOs in the Sprint Week 3, to add to the one that is currently booked in.  We are reviewing our user research options, and will assess next steps on Wednesday depending on responses received by then.  Additionally, there are further sessions lined up with internal stakeholders including: 

- Application Support
- Enhanced Registration 
- Data 
- Digital 
- Segmentation 
- Comms 
- Ops Transformation 

Many of these sessions are to understand the findings, plans and impact of recent and current initiatives. These inform the constraints and context against which  our recommendations for prototyping and service proposal will be made.   

Work is progressing on testing out a digital version of the existing application form using the GDS prototyping kit. We are using this ‘lift and shift’ to learn about the potential user interaction challenges for the current form, as well as to examine the viability of the tooling for the next phase. 

Show and tells resume on Fri 3 Jul, and we look forward to elaborating on the insights gathering over this fortnight.
